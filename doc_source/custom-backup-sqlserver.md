# Backing up and restoring an Amazon RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance<a name="custom-backup-sqlserver"></a>

Like Amazon RDS, RDS Custom creates and saves automated backups of your RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance during the backup window of your DB instance\. You can also back up your DB instance manually\. 

The procedure is identical to taking a snapshot of an Amazon RDS DB instance\. The first snapshot of an RDS Custom DB instance contains the data for the full DB instance\. Subsequent snapshots are incremental\.

Restore DB snapshots using either the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI\.

## Creating an RDS Custom for SQL Server snapshot<a name="custom-backup-sqlserver.creating"></a>

RDS Custom for SQL Server creates a storage volume snapshot of your DB instance, backing up the entire DB instance and not just individual databases\. When you create a snapshot, specify which RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance to back up\. Give your snapshot a name so you can restore from it later\.

When you create a snapshot, RDS Custom for SQL Server creates an Amazon EBS snapshot for every volume attached to the DB instance\. RDS Custom for SQL Server uses the EBS snapshot of the root volume to register a new Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\)\. To make snapshots easy to associate with a specific DB instance, they're tagged with `DBSnapshotIdentifier`, `DbiResourceId`, and `VolumeType`\.

Creating a DB snapshot results in a brief I/O suspension\. This suspension can last from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the size and class of your DB instance\. The snapshot creation time varies with the size of your database\. Because the snapshot includes the entire storage volume, the size of files, such as temporary files, also affects snapshot creation time\. To learn more about creating snapshots, see [Creating a DB snapshot](USER_CreateSnapshot.md)\.

Create an RDS Custom for SQL Server snapshot using the console or the AWS CLI\.

### Console<a name="USER_CreateSnapshot-sqlserver.CON"></a>

**To create an RDS Custom snapshot**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**\.

1. In the list of RDS Custom DB instances, choose the instance for which you want to take a snapshot\.

1. For **Actions**, choose **Take snapshot**\.

   The **Take DB snapshot** window appears\.

1. For **Snapshot name**, enter the name of the snapshot\.

1. Choose **Take snapshot**\.

### AWS CLI<a name="USER_CreateSnapshot-sqlserver.CLI"></a>

You create a snapshot of an RDS Custom DB instance by using the [create\-db\-snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-snapshot.html) AWS CLI command\.

Specify the following options:
+ `--db-instance-identifier` – Identifies which RDS Custom DB instance you are going to back up
+ `--db-snapshot-identifier` – Names your RDS Custom snapshot so you can restore from it later

In this example, you create a DB snapshot called *`my-custom-snapshot`* for an RDS Custom DB instance called `my-custom-instance`\.

**Example**  
For Linux, macOS, or Unix:  

```
1. aws rds create-db-snapshot \
2.     --db-instance-identifier my-custom-instance \
3.     --db-snapshot-identifier my-custom-snapshot
```
For Windows:  

```
1. aws rds create-db-snapshot ^
2.     --db-instance-identifier my-custom-instance ^
3.     --db-snapshot-identifier my-custom-snapshot
```

## Restoring from an RDS Custom for SQL Server DB snapshot<a name="custom-backup-sqlserver.restoring"></a>

When you restore an RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance, you provide the name of the DB snapshot and a name for the new instance\. You can't restore from a snapshot to an existing RDS Custom DB instance\. A new RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance is created when you restore\.

The restore process differs in the following ways from restore in Amazon RDS:
+ Before restoring a snapshot, RDS Custom for SQL Server backs up existing configuration files\. These files are available on the restored instance in the directory `/rdsdbdata/config/backup`\. RDS Custom for SQL Server restores the DB snapshot with default parameters and overwrites the previous database configuration files with existing ones\. Thus, the restored instance doesn't preserve custom parameters and changes to database configuration files\.
+ The restored database has the same name as in the snapshot\. You can't specify a different name\.

### Console<a name="custom-backup-sqlserver.restoring.console"></a>

**To restore an RDS Custom DB instance from a DB snapshot**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Snapshots**\.

1. Choose the DB snapshot that you want to restore from\.

1. For **Actions**, choose **Restore snapshot**\.

1. On the **Restore DB instance** page, for **DB instance identifier**, enter the name for your restored RDS Custom DB instance\.

1. Choose **Restore DB instance**\. 

### AWS CLI<a name="custom-backup-sqlserver.restoring.CLI"></a>

You restore an RDS Custom DB snapshot by using the [ restore\-db\-instance\-from\-db\-snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot.html) AWS CLI command\.

If the snapshot you are restoring from is for a private DB instance, make sure to specify both the correct `db-subnet-group-name` and `no-publicly-accessible`\. Otherwise, the DB instance defaults to publicly accessible\. The following options are required:
+ `db-snapshot-identifier` – Identifies the snapshot from which to restore
+ `db-instance-identifier` – Specifies the name of the RDS Custom DB instance to create from the DB snapshot
+ `custom-iam-instance-profile` – Specifies the instance profile associated with the underlying Amazon EC2 instance of an RDS Custom DB instance\.

The following code restores the snapshot named `my-custom-snapshot` for `my-custom-instance`\.

**Example**  
For Linux, macOS, or Unix:  

```
aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot \
  --db-snapshot-identifier my-custom-snapshot \
  --db-instance-identifier my-custom-instance \
  --custom-iam-instance-profile AWSRDSCustomInstanceProfileForRdsCustomInstance \
  --no-publicly-accessible
```
For Windows:  

```
aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot ^
  --db-snapshot-identifier my-custom-snapshot ^
  --db-instance-identifier my-custom-instance ^
  --custom-iam-instance-profile AWSRDSCustomInstanceProfileForRdsCustomInstance ^
  --no-publicly-accessible
```

## Restoring an RDS Custom for SQL Server instance to a point in time<a name="custom-backup.pitr-sqs"></a>

You can restore a DB instance to a specific point in time \(PITR\), creating a new DB instance\. To support PITR, your DB instances must have backup retention set to a nonzero value\.

The latest restorable time for an RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance depends on several factors, but is typically within 5 minutes of the current time\. To see the latest restorable time for a DB instance, use the AWS CLI [describe\-db\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.html) command and look at the value returned in the `LatestRestorableTime` field for the DB instance\. To see the latest restorable time for each DB instance in the Amazon RDS console, choose **Automated backups**\.

You can restore to any point in time within your backup retention period\. To see the earliest restorable time for each DB instance, choose **Automated backups** in the Amazon RDS console\.

For general information about PITR, see [Restoring a DB instance to a specified time](USER_PIT.md)\.

**Topics**
+ [PITR considerations for RDS Custom for SQL Server](#custom-backup.pitr.sqlserver)

### PITR considerations for RDS Custom for SQL Server<a name="custom-backup.pitr.sqlserver"></a>

In RDS Custom for SQL Server, PITR differs in the following important ways from PITR in Amazon RDS:
+ PITR only restores the databases in the DB instance\. It doesn't restore the operating system or files on the C: drive\.
+ For an RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance, a database is backed up automatically and is eligible for PITR only under the following conditions:
  + The database is online\.
  + Its recovery model is set to `FULL`\.
  + It's writable\.
  + It has its physical files on the D: drive\.
  + It's not listed in the `rds_pitr_blocked_databases` table\. For more information, see [Making databases ineligible for PITR](#custom-backup.pitr.sqlserver.ineligible)\.
+ RDS Custom for SQL Server allows up to 5,000 databases per DB instance\. However, the maximum number of databases restored by a PITR operation for an RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance is 100\. The 100 databases are determined by the order of their database ID\.

  Other databases that aren't part of PITR can be restored from DB snapshots, including the automated backups used for PITR\.
+ Adding a new database, renaming a database, or restoring a database that is eligible for PITR initiates a snapshot of the DB instance\.
+ Restored databases have the same name as in the source DB instance\. You can't specify a different name\.
+ `AWSRDSCustomSQLServerIamRolePolicy` requires new permissions\. For more information, see [Add an access policy to AWSRDSCustomSQLServerInstanceRole](custom-setup-sqlserver.md#custom-setup-sqlserver.iam.add-policy)\.
+ Time zone changes aren't supported for RDS Custom for SQL Server\. If you change the operating system or DB instance time zone, PITR \(and other automation\) doesn't work\.

#### Making databases ineligible for PITR<a name="custom-backup.pitr.sqlserver.ineligible"></a>

You can specify that certain RDS Custom for SQL Server databases aren't part of automated backups and PITR\. To do this, put their `database_id` values into a `rds_pitr_blocked_databases` table\. Use the following SQL script to create the table\.

**To create the rds\_pitr\_blocked\_databases table**
+ Run the following SQL script\.

  ```
  create table msdb..rds_pitr_blocked_databases
  (
  database_id INT NOT NULL,
  database_name SYSNAME NOT NULL,
  db_entry_updated_date datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT GETDATE(),
  db_entry_updated_by SYSNAME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_USER,
  PRIMARY KEY (database_id)
  );
  ```

For the list of eligible and ineligible databases, see the `RI.End` file in the `RDSCustomForSQLServer/Instances/DB_instance_resource_ID/TransactionLogMetadata` directory in the Amazon S3 bucket `do-not-delete-rds-custom-$ACCOUNT_ID-$REGION-unique_identifier`\. For more information about the `RI.End` file, see [Transaction logs in Amazon S3](#custom-backup.pitr.sqlserver.tlogs)\.

#### Transaction logs in Amazon S3<a name="custom-backup.pitr.sqlserver.tlogs"></a>

The backup retention period determines whether transaction logs for RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instances are automatically extracted and uploaded to Amazon S3\. A nonzero value means that automatic backups are created, and that the RDS Custom agent uploads the transaction logs to S3 every 5 minutes\.

Transaction log files on S3 are encrypted at rest using the AWS KMS key that you provided when you created your DB instance\. For more information, see [Protecting data using server\-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide*\.

The transaction logs for each database are uploaded to an S3 bucket named `do-not-delete-rds-custom-$ACCOUNT_ID-$REGION-unique_identifier`\. The `RDSCustomForSQLServer/Instances/DB_instance_resource_ID` directory in the S3 bucket contains two subdirectories:
+ `TransactionLogs` – Contains the transaction logs for each database and their respective metadata\.

  The transaction log file name follows the pattern `yyyyMMddHHmm.database_id.timestamp`, for example:

  ```
  202110202230.11.1634769287
  ```

  The same file name with the suffix `_metadata` contains information about the transaction log such as log sequence numbers, database name, and `RdsChunkCount`\. `RdsChunkCount` determines how many physical files represent a single transaction log file\. You might see files with suffixes `_0001`, `_0002`, and so on, which mean the physical chunks of a transaction log file\. If you want to use a chunked transaction log file, make sure to merge the chunks after downloading them\.

  Consider a scenario where you have the following files:
  + `202110202230.11.1634769287`
  + ` 202110202230.11.1634769287_0001`
  + ` 202110202230.11.1634769287_0002 `
  + ` 202110202230.11.1634769287_metadata`

  The `RdsChunkCount` is `3`\. The order for merging the files is the following: `202110202230.11.1634769287`, ` 202110202230.11.1634769287_0001`, `202110202230.11.1634769287_0002`\.
+ `TransactionLogMetadata` – Contains metadata information about each iteration of transaction log extraction\.

  The `RI.End` file contains information for all databases that had their transaction logs extracted, and all databases that exist but didn't have their transaction logs extracted\. The `RI.End` file name follows the pattern `yyyyMMddHHmm.RI.End.timestamp`, for example:

  ```
  202110202230.RI.End.1634769281
  ```

You can restore an RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instance to a point in time using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API\.

## Deleting an RDS Custom for SQL Server snapshot<a name="custom-backup-sqlserver.deleting"></a>

You can delete DB snapshots managed by RDS Custom for SQL Server when you no longer need them\. The deletion procedure is the same for both Amazon RDS and RDS Custom DB instances\.

The Amazon EBS snapshots for the binary and root volumes remain in your account for a longer time because they might be linked to some instances running in your account or to other RDS Custom for SQL Server snapshots\. These EBS snapshots are automatically deleted after they're no longer related to any existing RDS Custom for SQL Server resources \(DB instances or backups\)\.

### Console<a name="USER_DeleteSnapshot-sqlserver.CON"></a>

**To delete a snapshot of an RDS Custom DB instance**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

# Using Service\-Linked Roles for Amazon RDS<a name="UsingWithRDS.IAM.ServiceLinkedRoles"></a>

Amazon RDS uses AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)[ service\-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role)\. A service\-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to Amazon RDS\. Service\-linked roles are predefined by Amazon RDS and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf\. 

A service\-linked role makes using Amazon RDS easier because you don’t have to manually add the necessary permissions\. Amazon RDS defines the permissions of its service\-linked roles, and unless defined otherwise, only Amazon RDS can assume its roles\. The defined permissions include the trust policy and the permissions policy, and that permissions policy cannot be attached to any other IAM entity\.

You can delete the roles only after first deleting their related resources\. This protects your Amazon RDS resources because you can't inadvertently remove permission to access the resources\.

For information about other services that support service\-linked roles, see [AWS Services That Work with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html) and look for the services that have **Yes **in the **Service\-Linked Role** column\. Choose a **Yes** with a link to view the service\-linked role documentation for that service\.

## Service\-Linked Role Permissions for Amazon RDS<a name="service-linked-role-permissions"></a>

Amazon RDS uses the service\-linked role named **AWSServiceRoleForRDS** – to allow Amazon RDS to call AWS services on behalf of your DB instances\.

The AWSServiceRoleForRDS service\-linked role trusts the following services to assume the role:
+ `rds.amazonaws.com`

The role permissions policy allows Amazon RDS to complete the following actions on the specified resources:
+ Actions on `ec2`:
  + `AssignPrivateIpAddresses`
  + `AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress`
  + `CreateNetworkInterface`
  + `CreateSecurityGroup`
  + `DeleteNetworkInterface`
  + `DeleteSecurityGroup`
  + `DescribeAvailabilityZones`
  + `DescribeInternetGateways`
  + `DescribeSecurityGroups`
  + `DescribeSubnets`
  + `DescribeVpcAttribute`
  + `DescribeVpcs`
  + `ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute`
  + `RevokeSecurityGroupIngress`
  + `UnassignPrivateIpAddresses`
+ Actions on `sns`:
  + `ListTopic`
  + `Publish`
+ Actions on `cloudwatch`:
  + `PutMetricData`
  + `GetMetricData`
  + `CreateLogStream`
  + `PullLogEvents`
  + `DescribeLogStreams`
  + `CreateLogGroup`

**Note**  
You must configure permissions to allow an IAM entity \(such as a user, group, or role\) to create, edit, or delete a service\-linked role\. If you encounter the following error message:  
**Unable to create the resource\. Verify that you have permission to create service linked role\. Otherwise wait and try again later\.**  
 Make sure you have the following permissions enabled:   

```
{
    "Action": "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/aws-service-role/rds.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForRDS",
    "Condition": {
        "StringLike": {
            "iam:AWSServiceName":"rds.amazonaws.com"
        }
    }
}
```
 For more information, see [Service\-Linked Role Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#service-linked-role-permissions) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

## Creating a Service\-Linked Role for Amazon RDS<a name="create-service-linked-role"></a>

You don't need to manually create a service\-linked role\. When you create a DB instance, Amazon RDS creates the service\-linked role for you\. 

**Important**  
If you were using the Amazon RDS service before December 1, 2017, when it began supporting service\-linked roles, then Amazon RDS created the AWSServiceRoleForRDS role in your account\. To learn more, see [A New Role Appeared in My IAM Account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_roles.html#troubleshoot_roles_new-role-appeared)\.

If you delete this service\-linked role, and then need to create it again, you can use the same process to recreate the role in your account\. When you create a DB instance, Amazon RDS creates the service\-linked role for you again\. 

## Editing a Service\-Linked Role for Amazon RDS<a name="edit-service-linked-role"></a>

Amazon RDS does not allow you to edit the AWSServiceRoleForRDS service\-linked role\. After you create a service\-linked role, you cannot change the name of the role because various entities might reference the role\. However, you can edit the description of the role using IAM\. For more information, see [Editing a Service\-Linked Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#edit-service-linked-role) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

## Deleting a Service\-Linked Role for Amazon RDS<a name="delete-service-linked-role"></a>

If you no longer need to use a feature or service that requires a service\-linked role, we recommend that you delete that role\. That way you don’t have an unused entity that is not actively monitored or maintained\. However, you must delete all of your DB instances before you can delete the service\-linked role\.

### Cleaning Up a Service\-Linked Role<a name="service-linked-role-review-before-delete"></a>

Before you can use IAM to delete a service\-linked role, you must first confirm that the role has no active sessions and remove any resources used by the role\.

**To check whether the service\-linked role has an active session in the IAM console**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane of the IAM console, choose **Roles**\. Then choose the name \(not the check box\) of the AWSServiceRoleForRDS role\.

1. On the **Summary** page for the selected role, choose the **Access Advisor** tab\.

1. On the **Access Advisor** tab, review recent activity for the service\-linked role\.
**Note**  
If you are unsure whether Amazon RDS is using the AWSServiceRoleForRDS role, you can try to delete the role\. If the service is using the role, then the deletion fails and you can view the regions where the role is being used\. If the role is being used, then you must wait for the session to end before you can delete the role\. You cannot revoke the session for a service\-linked role\. 

If you want to remove the AWSServiceRoleForRDS role, you must first delete *all* of your DB instances \.

#### Deleting All of Your Instances<a name="delete-service-linked-role.delete-rds-instances"></a>

Use one of these procedures to delete each of your instances\.

**To delete an instance \(console\)**

1. Open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**\.

1. In the **Instances** list, choose the instance that you want to delete\.

1. Choose **Instance actions**, and then choose **Delete**\.

1. If you are prompted for **Create final Snapshot?**, choose **Yes** or **No**\.

1. If you chose **Yes** in the previous step, for **Final snapshot name** type the name of your final snapshot\.

1. Choose **Delete**\.

**To delete an instance \(CLI\)**  
See `[delete\-db\-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/delete-db-instance.html)` in the *AWS CLI Command Reference*\.

**To delete an instance \(API\)**  
See `[DeleteDBInstance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteDBInstance.html)` in the *Amazon RDS API Reference*\.

You can use the IAM console, the IAM CLI, or the IAM API to delete the AWSServiceRoleForRDS service\-linked role\. For more information, see [Deleting a Service\-Linked Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html#delete-service-linked-role) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

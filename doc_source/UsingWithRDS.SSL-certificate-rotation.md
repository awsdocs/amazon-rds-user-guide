# Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate<a name="UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation"></a>

**Note**  
If your application connects to an RDS DB instance using Secure Socket Layer \(SSL\) or Transport Layer Security \(TLS\), you must take the following steps *before March 5, 2020\.* Doing this means you can avoid interruption of connectivity between your applications and your RDS DB instances\.

As of September 19, 2019, Amazon RDS has published new Certificate Authority \(CA\) certificates for connecting to your RDS DB instances using SSL/TLS\. We provide these new CA certificates as an AWS security best practice\. For information about the new certificates and the supported AWS Regions, see [Using SSL/TLS to Encrypt a Connection to a DB Instance](UsingWithRDS.SSL.md)\.

The current CA certificates expire on March 5, 2020\. Therefore, we strongly recommend completing this change as soon as possible \(and no later than February 5, 2020\), to avoid disruption on the expiration date\. If the change is not completed, your applications will fail to connect to your RDS DB instances using SSL/TLS after March 5, 2020\. 

We encourage you to test the steps listed following in a development or staging environment before taking them for your production environments\. 

Before you update your DB instances to use the new CA certificate, make sure that you update your clients or applications connecting to your RDS databases\.

Any new RDS DB instances created after January 14, 2020 will use the new certificates by default\. If you want to temporarily modify new DB instances manually to use the old \(rds\-ca\-2015\) certificates, you can do so using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI\. Any DB instances created prior to January 14, 2020 use the rds\-ca\-2015 certificates until you update them to the rds\-ca\-2019 certificates\.

## Sample Script for Importing Certificates Into Your Trust Store<a name="UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-sample-script"></a>

The following is a sample shell script that imports the certificate bundle into a trust store on a Linux operating system\.

```
mydir=/tmp/certs
truststore=${mydir}/rds-truststore.jks
storepassword=changeit

curl -sS "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem" > ${mydir}/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem
awk 'split_after == 1 {n++;split_after=0} /-----END CERTIFICATE-----/ {split_after=1}{print > "rds-ca-" n ".pem"}' < ${mydir}/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem

for CERT in rds-ca-*; do
  alias=$(openssl x509 -noout -text -in $CERT | perl -ne 'next unless /Subject:/; s/.*CN=//; print')
  echo "Importing $alias"
  keytool -import -file ${CERT} -alias "${alias}" -storepass ${storepassword} -keystore ${truststore} -noprompt
  rm $CERT
done

rm ${mydir}/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem

echo "Trust store content is: "

keytool -list -v -keystore "$truststore" -storepass ${storepassword} | grep Alias | cut -d " " -f3- | while read alias 
do
   expiry=`keytool -list -v -keystore "$truststore" -storepass ${storepassword} -alias "${alias}" | grep Valid | perl -ne 'if(/until: (.*?)\n/) { print "$1\n"; }'`
   echo " Certificate ${alias} expires in '$expiry'" 
done
```

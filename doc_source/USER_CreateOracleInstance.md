# Creating a DB Instance Running the Oracle Database Engine<a name="USER_CreateOracleInstance"></a>

 The basic building block of Amazon RDS is the DB instance\. This is the environment in which you run your Oracle databases\. 

**Important**  
Before you can create or connect to a DB instance, you must complete the tasks in [Setting Up for Amazon RDS](CHAP_SettingUp.md)\.

For an example that walks you through the process of creating and connecting to a sample DB instance, see [Creating an Oracle DB Instance and Connecting to a Database on an Oracle DB Instance](CHAP_GettingStarted.CreatingConnecting.Oracle.md)\. 

**Note**  
If you are using the console, a new console interface is available for database creation\. Choose either the **New Console** or the **Original Console** instructions based on the console that you are using\. The **New Console** instructions are open by default\.

## New Console<a name="USER_CreateOracleInstance.CON"></a>

You can create a DB instance running Oracle with the AWS Management Console with **Easy Create** enabled or disabled\. With **Easy Create** enabled, you specify only the DB engine type, DB instance size, and DB instance identifier\. **Easy Create** uses the default setting for other configuration options\. With **Easy Create** not enabled, you specify more configuration options when you create a database, including ones for availability, security, backups, and maintenance\.

**Note**  
For this example, **Standard Create** is enabled, and **Easy Create** isn't enabled\. For information about creating an Oracle DB instance with **Easy Create** enabled, see [Creating an Oracle DB Instance and Connecting to a Database on an Oracle DB Instance](CHAP_GettingStarted.CreatingConnecting.Oracle.md)\.

**To create an Oracle DB instance**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. In the upper\-right corner of the AWS Management Console, choose the AWS Region in which you want to create the DB instance\. 

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**\.

1. Choose **Create database**\.

1. In **Choose a database creation method**, choose **Standard Create**\.

   The Oracle editions that are available vary by AWS Region\.  
![\[Engine options\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/OracleLaunchEE.png)

1. In **Engine options**, choose **Oracle**\. 

1. For **Edition**, choose the Oracle DB engine edition that you want to use\. The Oracle editions that are available vary by AWS Region\.

1. For **Version**, choose the Oracle version\.

1. The next step asks if you are planning to use the DB instance that you are creating for production\. If you are, choose **Production**\. When you choose **Production**, the following are also chosen in a later step:
   + **Multi\-AZ deployment** failover option
   + **Provisioned IOPS** storage option
   + **Enable deletion protection** option

1. To enter your master password, do the following:

   1. In the **Settings** section, open **Credential Settings**\.

   1. Clear the **Auto generate a password** check box\.

   1. \(Optional\) Change the **Master username** value and enter the same password in **Master password** and **Confirm password**\.

   By default, the new DB instance uses an automatically generated password for the master user\.

1. For the remaining sections, specify your DB instance settings\. For information about each setting, see [Settings for Oracle DB Instances](#USER_CreateOracleInstance.Settings)\. 

1. Choose **Create database**\. 

   If you chose to use an automatically generated password, the **View credential details** button appears on the **Databases** page\.

   To view the master user name and password for the DB instance, choose **View credential details**\.  
![\[Master user credentials after automatic password generation.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/easy-create-credentials.png)

   To connect to the DB instance as the master user, use the user name and password that appear\.
**Important**  
You can't view the master user password again\. If you don't record it, you might have to change it\. If you need to change the master user password after the DB instance is available, you can modify the DB instance to do so\. For more information about modifying a DB instance, see [Modifying a DB Instance Running the Oracle Database Engine](USER_ModifyInstance.Oracle.md)\.

1. For **Databases**, choose the name of the new Oracle DB instance\.

   On the RDS console, the details for the new DB instance appear\. The DB instance has a status of **creating** until the DB instance is created and ready for use\. When the state changes to **available**, you can connect to the DB instance\. Depending on the DB instance class and storage allocated, it can take several minutes for the new instance to be available\.

## AWS CLI<a name="USER_CreateOracleInstance.CLI"></a>

To create an Oracle DB instance by using the AWS CLI, call the [create\-db\-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html) command with the parameters below\. For information about each setting, see [Settings for Oracle DB Instances](#USER_CreateOracleInstance.Settings)\. 
+ `--db-instance-identifier`
+ `--db-instance-class`
+ `--db-security-groups`
+ `--db-subnet-group`
+ `--engine`
+ `--master-user-name`
+ `--master-user-password`
+ `--allocated-storage`
+ `--backup-retention-period`

**Example**  
The following command will launch the example DB instance\.  
For Linux, OS X, or Unix:  

```
 1. aws rds create-db-instance \
 2.     --engine oracle-se1 \
 3.     --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
 4.     --allocated-storage 20 \ 
 5.     --db-instance-class db.m1.small \
 6.     --db-security-groups mydbsecuritygroup \
 7.     --db-subnet-group mydbsubnetgroup \
 8.     --master-username masterawsuser \
 9.     --master-user-password masteruserpassword \
10.     --backup-retention-period 3
```
For Windows:  

```
 1. aws rds create-db-instance ^
 2.     --engine oracle-se1 ^
 3.     --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance ^
 4.     --allocated-storage 20 ^
 5.     --db-instance-class db.m1.small ^

## Settings for Oracle DB Instances<a name="USER_CreateOracleInstance.Settings"></a>

The following table contains details about settings that you choose when you create an Oracle DB instance\. 


****  

| Setting | Setting Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Allocated storage  |  The amount of storage to allocate your DB instance \(in gigabytes\)\. In some cases, allocating a higher amount of storage for your DB instance than the size of your database can improve I/O performance\.  For more information, see [Amazon RDS DB Instance Storage](CHAP_Storage.md)\.   | 
|  Auto minor version upgrade  |  **Enable auto minor version upgrade** to enable your DB instance to receive preferred minor DB engine version upgrades automatically when they become available\. Amazon RDS performs automatic minor version upgrades in the maintenance window\. Some options, such as Oracle Locator, Oracle Multimedia, and Oracle Spatial, require that you enable automatic minor version upgrades\. Upgrades for DB instances that use these options are installed during your scheduled maintenance window, and an outage occurs during the upgrade\. You can't disable automatic minor version upgrades at the same time as you modify the option group to remove such an option\.   | 
|  Availability zone  |  The Availability Zone for your DB instance\. Use the default of **No Preference** unless you need to specify a particular Availability Zone\.  For more information, see [Regions and Availability Zones](Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.md)\.   | 
|  Backup retention period  |  The number of days that you want automatic backups of your DB instance to be kept\. For any nontrivial instance, set this value to **1** or greater\.  For more information, see [Working With Backups](USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.md)\.   | 
|  Backup window  |  The time period during which Amazon RDS automatically takes a backup of your DB instance\. Unless you have a specific time that you want to have your database backed up, use the default of **No Preference**\.  For more information, see [Working With Backups](USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.md)\.   | 
|  Character set  |  The character set for your DB instance\. The default value of **AL32UTF8** is for the Unicode 5\.0 UTF\-8 Universal character set\. You can't change the character set after the DB instance is created\.  For more information, see [Oracle Character Sets Supported in Amazon RDS](Appendix.OracleCharacterSets.md)\.   | 
|  Copy tags to snapshots  |  This option copies any DB instance tags to a DB snapshot when you create a snapshot\.  For more information, see [Tagging Amazon RDS Resources](USER_Tagging.md)\.   | 
|  Database authentication  |  The database authentication option you want to use\. Choose **Password authentication** to authenticate database users with database passwords only\. Choose **Password and Kerberos authentication** to authenticate database users with database passwords and Kerberos authentication through an AWS Managed Microsoft AD created with AWS Directory Service\. Next, choose the directory or choose **Create a new Directory**\. For more information, see [Using Kerberos Authentication with Amazon RDS for Oracle](oracle-kerberos.md)\.  | 
|  Database name  |  The name for the database on your DB instance\. The name must begin with a letter and contain up to eight alphanumeric characters\. You can't specify the string NULL, or any other reserved word, for the database name\. If you don't provide a name, Amazon RDS creates a database named `ORCL`\.  | 
|  Database port  |  The port that you want to access the DB instance through\. Oracle installations default to port 1521\.   | 
|  DB engine version  |  The version of Oracle that you want to use\.  | 
|  DB instance class  |  The DB instance class that you want to use\.  For more information, see [Choosing the DB Instance Class](Concepts.DBInstanceClass.md) and [DB Instance Class Support for Oracle](CHAP_Oracle.md#Oracle.Concepts.InstanceClasses)\.   | 
|  DB instance identifier  |  The name for your DB instance\. The name must be unique for your account and AWS Region\. You can add some intelligence to the name, such as including the AWS Region and DB engine you chose, for example **oracle\-instance1**\.   | 
|  DB parameter group  |  A parameter group for your DB instance\. You can choose the default parameter group or you can create a custom parameter group\.  For more information, see [Working with DB Parameter Groups](USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.md) and [Modifying Oracle sqlnet\.ora Parameters](USER_ModifyInstance.Oracle.md#USER_ModifyInstance.Oracle.sqlnet)\.   | 
| Deletion protection |  **Enable deletion protection** to prevent your DB instance from being deleted\. If you create a production DB instance with the AWS Management Console, deletion protection is enabled by default\. For more information, see [Deleting a DB Instance](USER_DeleteInstance.md)\.  | 
|  Encryption  |  **Enable Encryption** to enable encryption at rest for this DB instance\.  For more information, see [Encrypting Amazon RDS Resources](Overview.Encryption.md)\.   | 
|  Enhanced Monitoring  |  **Enable enhanced monitoring** to enable gathering metrics in real time for the operating system that your DB instance runs on\.   For more information, see [Enhanced Monitoring](USER_Monitoring.OS.md)\.   | 
|  License model  |  The license model that you want to use\. Choose **license\-included** to use the general license agreement for Oracle\. Choose **bring\-your\-own\-license** to use your existing Oracle license\.  For more information, see [Oracle Licensing](CHAP_Oracle.md#Oracle.Concepts.Licensing)\.   | 
|  Maintenance window  |  The 30\-minute window in which pending modifications to your DB instance are applied\. If the time period doesn't matter, choose **No Preference**\.  For more information, see [The Amazon RDS Maintenance Window](USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.md#Concepts.DBMaintenance)\.   | 
|  Master password  |  The password for your master user account\. The password must contain from 8 to 30 printable ASCII characters \(excluding /,", and @\)\.   | 
|  Master username  |  The name that you use as the master user name to log on to your DB instance with all database privileges\. This user account is used to log in to the DB instance and is granted DBA privileges\.  For more information, see [Oracle Security](CHAP_Oracle.md#Oracle.Concepts.RestrictedDBAPrivileges)\.   | 
|  Multi\-AZ deployment  |  **Create a standby instance** to create a passive secondary replica of your DB instance in another Availability Zone for failover support\. We recommend Multi\-AZ for production workloads to maintain high availability\. For development and testing, you can choose **Do not create a standby instance**\.  For more information, see [Regions and Availability Zones](Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.md)\.   | 
|  Option group  |  An option group for your DB instance\. You can choose the default option group or you can create a custom option group\.  For more information, see [Working with Option Groups](USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.md)\.   | 
| Performance Insights |  **Enable Performance Insights** to monitor your DB instance load so that you can analyze and troubleshoot your database performance\. Choose a retention period to determine how much rolling data history to retain\. The default of seven days is in the free tier\. Long\-term retention \(two years\) is priced per vCPU per month\. Choose a master key to protect the key used to encrypt this database volume\. Choose from the master keys in your account, or enter the key from a different account\. For more information, see [Using Amazon RDS Performance Insights](USER_PerfInsights.md)\.  | 
|  Publicly accessible  |  **Yes** to give the DB instance a public IP address, meaning that it's accessible outside the VPC\. To be publicly accessible, the DB instance also has to be in a public subnet in the VPC\. **No** to make the DB instance accessible only from inside the VPC\. For more information, see [Hiding a DB Instance in a VPC from the Internet](USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.md#USER_VPC.Hiding)\.   | 
|  Storage autoscaling  |  **Enable storage autoscaling** to enable Amazon RDS to automatically increase storage when needed to avoid having your DB instance run out of storage space\. Use **Maximum storage threshold** to set the upper limit for Amazon RDS to automatically increase storage for your DB instance\. The default is 1,000 GiB\. For more information, see [Managing Capacity Automatically with Amazon RDS Storage Autoscaling](USER_PIOPS.StorageTypes.md#USER_PIOPS.Autoscaling)\.   | 
|  Storage type  |  The storage type for your DB instance\.  For more information, see [Amazon RDS Storage Types](CHAP_Storage.md#Concepts.Storage)\.   | 
|  Subnet group  |  This setting depends on the platform that you are on\. If you are a new customer to AWS, keep the subnet group set to **default**, which is the default DB subnet group that was created for your account\. If you are creating a DB instance on the earlier E2\-Classic platform, you might want your DB instance in a specific VPC\. In this case, choose the DB subnet group that you created for that VPC\.   | 
|  Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\)  |  This setting depends on the platform that you are on\. If you are a new customer to AWS, choose the default VPC shown\. If you are creating a DB instance on the earlier E2\-Classic platform that doesn't use a VPC, choose **Not in VPC**\.  For more information, see [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud VPCs and Amazon RDS](USER_VPC.md)\.   | 
|  VPC security groups  | If you are a new customer to AWS, Create new to create a new VPC security group\. Otherwise, Choose existing, then choose from security groups that you previously created\.When you choose **Create new** in the RDS console, a new security group is created\. This new security group has an inbound rule that allows access to the DB instance from the IP address detected in your browser\.For more information, see [Working with DB Security Groups \(EC2\-Classic Platform\)](USER_WorkingWithSecurityGroups.md)\.  |

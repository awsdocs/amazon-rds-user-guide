# Logging and Monitoring in Amazon RDS<a name="Overview.LoggingAndMonitoring"></a>

Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of Amazon RDS and your AWS solutions\. You should collect monitoring data from all of the parts of your AWS solution so that you can more easily debug a multi\-point failure if one occurs\. AWS provides several tools for monitoring your Amazon RDS resources and responding to potential incidents:

**Amazon CloudWatch Alarms**  
Using Amazon CloudWatch alarms, you watch a single metric over a time period that you specify\. If the metric exceeds a given threshold, a notification is sent to an Amazon SNS topic or AWS Auto Scaling policy\. CloudWatch alarms do not invoke actions because they are in a particular state\. Rather the state must have changed and been maintained for a specified number of periods\. For more information, see [Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch](MonitoringOverview.md#monitoring-cloudwatch)\.

**AWS CloudTrail Logs**  
CloudTrail provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in Amazon RDS\. CloudTrail captures all API calls for Amazon RDS as events, including calls from the console and from code calls to Amazon RDS API operations\. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made to Amazon RDS, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details\. For more information, see [Logging Amazon RDS API Calls with AWS CloudTrail](logging-using-cloudtrail.md)\.

**Enhanced Monitoring**  
Amazon RDS provides metrics in real time for the operating system \(OS\) that your DB instance runs on\. You can view the metrics for your DB instance using the console, or consume the Enhanced Monitoring JSON output from Amazon CloudWatch Logs in a monitoring system of your choice\. For more information, see [Enhanced Monitoring](USER_Monitoring.OS.md)\.

**Amazon RDS Performance Insights**  
Performance Insights expands on existing Amazon RDS monitoring features to illustrate your database's performance and help you analyze any issues that affect it\. With the Performance Insights dashboard, you can visualize the database load and filter the load by waits, SQL statements, hosts, or users\. For more information, see [Using Amazon RDS Performance Insights](USER_PerfInsights.md)\.

**Database Logs**  
You can view, download, and watch database logs using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or RDS API\. For more information, see [Amazon RDS Database Log Files](USER_LogAccess.md)\.

**Amazon RDS Recommendations**  
Amazon RDS provides automated recommendations for database resources\. These recommendations provide best practice guidance by analyzing DB instance configuration, usage, and performance data\. For more information, see [Using Amazon RDS Recommendations](USER_Recommendations.md)\.

**Amazon RDS Event Notification**  
Amazon RDS uses the Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) to provide notification when an Amazon RDS event occurs\. These notifications can be in any notification form supported by Amazon SNS for an AWS Region, such as an email, a text message, or a call to an HTTP endpoint\. For more information, see [Using Amazon RDS Event Notification](USER_Events.md)\.

**AWS Trusted Advisor**  
Trusted Advisor draws upon best practices learned from serving hundreds of thousands of AWS customers\. Trusted Advisor inspects your AWS environment and then makes recommendations when opportunities exist to save money, improve system availability and performance, or help close security gaps\. All AWS customers have access to five Trusted Advisor checks\. Customers with a Business or Enterprise support plan can view all Trusted Advisor checks\.   
Trusted Advisor has the following Amazon RDS\-related checks:  
+ Amazon RDS Idle DB Instances
+ Amazon RDS Security Group Access Risk
+ Amazon RDS Backups
+ Amazon RDS Multi\-AZ
For more information on these checks, see [Trusted Advisor Best Practices \(Checks\)](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/best-practices/)\.

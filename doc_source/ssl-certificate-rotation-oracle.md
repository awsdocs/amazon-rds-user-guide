# Updating Applications to Connect to Oracle DB Instances Using New SSL/TLS Certificates<a name="ssl-certificate-rotation-oracle"></a>

As of September 19, 2019, Amazon RDS has published new Certificate Authority \(CA\) certificates for connecting to your RDS DB instances using Secure Socket Layer or Transport Layer Security \(SSL/TLS\)\. The previous CA certificates expire on March 5, 2020\. Following, you can find information about updating your applications to use the new certificates\. If your application connects to an RDS DB instance using SSL/TLS, you must take the following steps before **March 5, 2020**\. Doing this means you can avoid interruption of connectivity between your applications and your RDS DB instances\.

This topic can help you to determine whether any client applications use SSL/TLS to connect to your DB instances\. 

**Note**  
For client applications that use SSL/TLS to connect to your DB instances, you must update your client application trust stores to include the new CA certificates\. 

After you update your CA certificates in the client application trust stores, you can rotate the certificates on your DB instances\. We strongly recommend testing these procedures in a development or staging environment before implementing them in your production environments\.

For more information about certificate rotation, see [Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate](UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.md)\. For information about using SSL/TLS with Oracle DB instances, see [Oracle Secure Sockets Layer](Appendix.Oracle.Options.SSL.md)\.

## Determining Whether Any Applications Are Connecting to Your Oracle DB Instance Using SSL<a name="ssl-certificate-rotation-oracle.determining"></a>

If your Oracle DB instance uses an option group with the `SSL` option added, you might be using SSL\. Check this by following the instructions in [Listing the Options and Option Settings for an Option Group](USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.md#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.ListOption)\. For information about the `SSL` option, see [Oracle Secure Sockets Layer](Appendix.Oracle.Options.SSL.md)\.

Check the listener log to determine whether there are SSL connections\. The following is sample output in a listener log\.

```
date time * (CONNECT_DATA=(CID=(PROGRAM=program)
(HOST=host)(USER=user))(SID=sid)) * 
(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcps)(HOST=host)(PORT=port)) * establish * ORCL * 0
```

When `PROTOCOL` has the value `tcps` for an entry, it shows an SSL connection\. However, when `HOST` is `127.0.0.1`, you can ignore the entry\. Connections from `127.0.0.1` are a local management agent on the DB instance\. These connections aren't external SSL connections\. Therefore, you have applications connecting using SSL if you see listener log entries where `PROTOCOL` is `tcps` and `HOST` is *not* `127.0.0.1`\.

To check the listener log, you can publish the log to Amazon CloudWatch Logs\. For more information, see [Publishing Oracle Logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs](USER_LogAccess.Concepts.Oracle.md#USER_LogAccess.Oracle.PublishtoCloudWatchLogs)\.

## Updating Your Application Trust Store<a name="ssl-certificate-rotation-oracle.updating-trust-store"></a>

You can update the trust store for applications that use SQL\*Plus or JDBC for SSL/TLS connections\.

### Updating Your Application Trust Store for SQL\*Plus<a name="ssl-certificate-rotation-oracle.updating-trust-store.sqlplus"></a>

You can update the trust store for applications that use SQL\*Plus for SSL/TLS connections\.

**Note**  
When you update the trust store, you can retain older certificates in addition to adding the new certificates\.

**To update the trust store for SQL\*Plus applications**

1. Download the 2019 root certificate that works for all AWS Regions and put the file in the `ssl_wallet` directory\.

   For information about downloading the root certificate, see [Using SSL/TLS to Encrypt a Connection to a DB Instance](UsingWithRDS.SSL.md)\.

1. Run the following command to update the Oracle wallet\.

   ```
   prompt>orapki wallet add -wallet $ORACLE_HOME/ssl_wallet -trusted_cert -cert
         $ORACLE_HOME/ssl_wallet/rds-ca-2019-root.pem -auto_login_only
   ```

   Replace the file name with the one that you downloaded\.

1. Run the following command to confirm that the wallet was updated successfully\.

   ```
   prompt>orapki wallet display -wallet $ORACLE_HOME/ssl_wallet 
   ```

   Your output should contain the following\.

   ```
   Trusted Certificates: 
   Subject: CN=Amazon RDS Root 2019 CA,OU=Amazon RDS,O=Amazon Web Services\, Inc.,L=Seattle,ST=Washington,C=US
   ```

### Updating Your Application Trust Store for JDBC<a name="ssl-certificate-rotation-oracle.updating-trust-store.jdbc"></a>

You can update the trust store for applications that use JDBC for SSL/TLS connections\.

**To update the trust store for JDBC applications**

1. Download the 2019 root certificate that works for all AWS Regions and put the file in the ssl\_wallet directory\.

   For information about downloading the root certificate, see [Using SSL/TLS to Encrypt a Connection to a DB Instance](UsingWithRDS.SSL.md)\.

1. Convert the certificate to \.der format using the following command\.

   ```
   openssl x509 -outform der -in rds-ca-2019-root.pem -out rds-ca-2019-root.der                    
   ```

   Replace the file name with the one that you downloaded\.

1. Import the certificate into the key store using the following command\. 

   ```
   keytool -import -alias rds-root -keystore clientkeystore -file rds-ca-2019-root.der                    
   ```

1. Confirm that the key store was updated successfully\.

   ```
   keytool -list -v -keystore clientkeystore.jks                        
   ```

   Enter the key store password when you are prompted for it\.

   Your output should contain the following\.

   ```
   rds-root,date, trustedCertEntry, 
   Certificate fingerprint (SHA1): D4:0D:DB:29:E3:75:0D:FF:A6:71:C3:14:0B:BF:5F:47:8D:1C:80:96
   # This fingerprint should match the output from the below command
   openssl x509 -fingerprint -in rds-ca-2019-root.pem -noout
   ```

## Example Java Code for Establishing SSL Connections<a name="ssl-certificate-rotation-oracle.java-example"></a>

The following code example shows how to set up the SSL connection using JDBC\.

```
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.util.Properties;
 
public class OracleSslConnectionTest {
    private static final String DB_SERVER_NAME = "<dns-name-provided-by-amazon-rds>";
    private static final Integer SSL_PORT = "<ssl-option-port-configured-in-option-group>";
    private static final String DB_SID = "<oracle-sid>";
    private static final String DB_USER = "<user name>";
    private static final String DB_PASSWORD = "<password>";
    // This key store has only the prod root ca.
    private static final String KEY_STORE_FILE_PATH = "<file-path-to-keystore>";
    private static final String KEY_STORE_PASS = "<keystore-password>";
 
    public static void main(String[] args) throws SQLException {
        final Properties properties = new Properties();
        final String connectionString = String.format(
                "jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCPS)(HOST=%s)(PORT=%d))(CONNECT_DATA=(SID=%s)))",
                DB_SERVER_NAME, SSL_PORT, DB_SID);
        properties.put("user", DB_USER);
        properties.put("password", DB_PASSWORD);
        properties.put("oracle.jdbc.J2EE13Compliant", "true");
        properties.put("javax.net.ssl.trustStore", KEY_STORE_FILE_PATH);
        properties.put("javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType", "JKS");
        properties.put("javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword", KEY_STORE_PASS);
        final Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(connectionString, properties);
        // If no exception, that means handshake has passed, and an SSL connection can be opened
    }
}
```

**Important**  
After you have determined that your database connections use SSL/TLS and have updated your application trust store, you can update your database to use the rds\-ca\-2019 certificates\. For instructions, see step 3 in [Updating Your CA Certificate by Modifying Your DB Instance](UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.md#UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation-updating)\.

# Using Kerberos authentication for MySQL<a name="mysql-kerberos"></a>

 You can use Kerberos authentication to authenticate users when they connect to your MySQL DB instance\. The DB instance works with AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory \(AWS Managed Microsoft AD\) to enable Kerberos authentication\. When users authenticate with a MySQL DB instance joined to the trusting domain, authentication requests are forwarded\. Forwarded requests go to the domain directory that you create with AWS Directory Service\. 

 Keeping all of your credentials in the same directory can save you time and effort\. With this approach, you have a centralized place for storing and managing credentials for multiple DB instances\. Using a directory can also improve your overall security profile\. 

Amazon RDS supports Kerberos authentication for MySQL DB instances in the following AWS Regions:
+ US East \(Ohio\)
+ US East \(N\. Virginia\)
+ US West \(N\. California\)
+ US West \(Oregon\)
+ Asia Pacific \(Mumbai\)
+ Asia Pacific \(Seoul\)
+ Asia Pacific \(Singapore\)
+ Asia Pacific \(Sydney\)
+ Asia Pacific \(Tokyo\)
+ Canada \(Central\)
+ Europe \(Frankfurt\)
+ Europe \(Ireland\)
+ Europe \(London\)
+ Europe \(Stockholm\)
+ South America \(São Paulo\)
+ China \(Beijing\)
+ China \(Ningxia\)

 To set up Kerberos authentication for a MySQL DB instance, complete the following general steps, described in more detail later: 

1.  Use AWS Managed Microsoft AD to create an AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory\. You can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS Directory Service to create the directory\. For details about doing so, see [Create your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ms_ad_getting_started_create_directory.html) in the *AWS Directory Service Administration Guide*\. 

1.  Create an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) role that uses the managed IAM policy `AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess`\. The role allows Amazon RDS to make calls to your directory\. 

    For the role to allow access, the AWS Security Token Service \(AWS STS\) endpoint must be activated in the AWS Region for your AWS account\. AWS STS endpoints are active by default in all AWS Regions, and you can use them without any further actions\. For more information, see [ Activating and deactivating AWS STS in an AWS Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html#sts-regions-activate-deactivate) in the *IAM User Guide*\. 

1.  Create and configure users in the AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory using the Microsoft Active Directory tools\. For more information about creating users in your Active Directory, see [Manage users and groups in AWS managed Microsoft AD](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ms_ad_manage_users_groups.html) in the *AWS Directory Service Administration Guide*\. 

1.  Create or modify a MySQL DB instance\. If you use either the CLI or RDS API in the create request, specify a domain identifier with the `Domain` parameter\. Use the `d-*` identifier that was generated when you created your directory and the name of the role that you created\. 

    If you modify an existing MySQL DB instance to use Kerberos authentication, set the domain and IAM role parameters for the DB instance\. Locate the DB instance in the same VPC as the domain directory\. 

1.  Use the Amazon RDS master user credentials to connect to the MySQL DB instance\. Create the user in MySQL using the `CREATE USER` clause `IDENTIFIED WITH 'auth_pam'`\. Users that you create this way can log in to the MySQL DB instance using Kerberos authentication\. 

## Setting up Kerberos authentication for MySQL DB instances<a name="mysql-kerberos-setting-up"></a>

 You use AWS Managed Microsoft AD to set up Kerberos authentication for a MySQL DB instance\. To set up Kerberos authentication, you take the following steps\. 

### Step 1: Create a directory using AWS Managed Microsoft AD<a name="mysql-kerberos-setting-up.create-directory"></a>

 AWS Directory Service creates a fully managed Active Directory in the AWS Cloud\. When you create an AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory, AWS Directory Service creates two domain controllers and Domain Name System \(DNS\) servers on your behalf\. The directory servers are created in different subnets in a VPC\. This redundancy helps make sure that your directory remains accessible even if a failure occurs\. 

 When you create an AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory, AWS Directory Service performs the following tasks on your behalf: 
+  Sets up an Active Directory within the VPC\. 
+  Creates a directory administrator account with the user name Admin and the specified password\. You use this account to manage your directory\. 
**Note**  
 Be sure to save this password\. AWS Directory Service doesn't store it\. You can reset it, but you can't retrieve it\. 
+  Creates a security group for the directory controllers\. 

 When you launch an AWS Managed Microsoft AD, AWS creates an Organizational Unit \(OU\) that contains all of your directory's objects\. This OU has the NetBIOS name that you typed when you created your directory and is located in the domain root\. The domain root is owned and managed by AWS\. 

 The Admin account that was created with your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory has permissions for the most common administrative activities for your OU: 
+  Create, update, or delete users 
+  Add resources to your domain such as file or print servers, and then assign permissions for those resources to users in your OU 
+  Create additional OUs and containers 
+  Delegate authority 
+  Restore deleted objects from the Active Directory Recycle Bin 
+  Run AD and DNS Windows PowerShell modules on the Active Directory Web Service 

 The Admin account also has rights to perform the following domain\-wide activities: 
+  Manage DNS configurations \(add, remove, or update records, zones, and forwarders\) 
+  View DNS event logs 
+  View security event logs 

**To create a directory with AWS Managed Microsoft AD**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Directory Service console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/directoryservicev2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/directoryservicev2/)\.

1.  In the navigation pane, choose **Directories** and choose **Set up Directory**\. 

1.  Choose **AWS Managed Microsoft AD**\. AWS Managed Microsoft AD is the only option that you can currently use with Amazon RDS\. 

1.  Enter the following information:   
**Directory DNS name**  
 The fully qualified name for the directory, such as **corp\.example\.com**\.   
**Directory NetBIOS name**  
 The short name for the directory, such as **CORP**\.   
**Directory description**  
 \(Optional\) A description for the directory\.   
**Admin password**  
 The password for the directory administrator\. The directory creation process creates an administrator account with the user name Admin and this password\.   
 The directory administrator password and can't include the word "admin\." The password is case\-sensitive and must be 8–64 characters in length\. It must also contain at least one character from three of the following four categories:   
   +  Lowercase letters \(a–z\) 
   +  Uppercase letters \(A–Z\) 
   +  Numbers \(0–9\) 
   +  Non\-alphanumeric characters \(\~\!@\#$%^&\*\_\-\+=`\|\\\(\)\{\}\[\]:;"'<>,\.?/\)   
**Confirm password**  
 The administrator password retyped\. 

1. Choose **Next**\.

1.  Enter the following information in the **Networking** section and then choose **Next**:   
**VPC**  
 The VPC for the directory\. Create the MySQL DB instance in this same VPC\.   
**Subnets**  
 Subnets for the directory servers\. The two subnets must be in different Availability Zones\. 

1.  Review the directory information and make any necessary changes\. When the information is correct, choose **Create directory**\.   
![\[Directory details page during creation\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/WinAuth2.png)

 It takes several minutes for the directory to be created\. When it has been successfully created, the **Status** value changes to **Active**\. 

 To see information about your directory, choose the directory name in the directory listing\. Note the **Directory ID** value because you need this value when you create or modify your MySQL DB instance\. 

![\[Directory details page\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/WinAuth3.png)

### Step 2: Create the IAM role for use by Amazon RDS<a name="mysql-kerberos-setting-up.CreateIAMRole"></a>

For Amazon RDS to call AWS Directory Service for you, an IAM role that uses the managed IAM policy `AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess` is required\. This role allows Amazon RDS to make calls to the AWS Directory Service\.

When a DB instance is created using the AWS Management Console and the console user has the `iam:CreateRole` permission, the console creates this role automatically\. In this case, the role name is `rds-directoryservice-kerberos-access-role`\. Otherwise, you must create the IAM role manually\. When you create this IAM role, choose `Directory Service`, and attach the AWS managed policy `AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess` to it\.

For more information about creating IAM roles for a service, see [Creating a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

**Note**  
The IAM role used for Windows Authentication for RDS for Microsoft SQL Server can't be used for RDS for MySQL\.

Optionally, you can create policies with the required permissions instead of using the managed IAM policy `AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess`\. In this case, the IAM role must have the following IAM trust policy\.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": [
          "directoryservice.rds.amazonaws.com",
          "rds.amazonaws.com"
        ]
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

The role must also have the following IAM role policy\.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "ds:DescribeDirectories",
        "ds:AuthorizeApplication",
        "ds:UnauthorizeApplication",
        "ds:GetAuthorizedApplicationDetails"
      ],
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Create and configure users<a name="mysql-kerberos-setting-up.create-users"></a>

 You can create users with the Active Directory Users and Computers tool\. This tool is part of the Active Directory Domain Services and Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services tools\. Users represent individual people or entities that have access to your directory\. 

 To create users in an AWS Directory Service directory, you must be connected to an Amazon EC2 instance based on Microsoft Windows\. This instance must be a member of the AWS Directory Service directory and be logged in as a user that has privileges to create users\. For more information, see [Manage users and groups in AWS Managed Microsoft AD](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/creating_ad_users_and_groups.html) in the *AWS Directory Service Administration Guide*\. 

### Step 4: Create or modify a MySQL DB instance<a name="mysql-kerberos-setting-up.create-modify"></a>

Create or modify a MySQL DB instance for use with your directory\. You can use the console, CLI, or RDS API to associate a DB instance with a directory\. You can do this in one of the following ways:
+ Create a new MySQL DB instance using the console, the [ create\-db\-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html) CLI command, or the [CreateDBInstance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDBInstance.html) RDS API operation\.

  For instructions, see [Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance](USER_CreateDBInstance.md)\.
+ Modify an existing MySQL DB instance using the console, the [modify\-db\-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.html) CLI command, or the [ModifyDBInstance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyDBInstance.html) RDS API operation\.

  For instructions, see [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB instance](Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.md)\.
+ Restore a MySQL DB instance from a DB snapshot using the console, the [ restore\-db\-instance\-from\-db\-snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot.html) CLI command, or the [ RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot.html) RDS API operation\.

  For instructions, see [Restoring from a DB snapshot](USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.md)\.
+ Restore a MySQL DB instance to a point\-in\-time using the console, the [ restore\-db\-instance\-to\-point\-in\-time](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time.html) CLI command, or the [ RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime.html) RDS API operation\.

  For instructions, see [Restoring a DB instance to a specified time](USER_PIT.md)\.

Kerberos authentication is only supported for MySQL DB instances in a VPC\. The DB instance can be in the same VPC as the directory, or in a different VPC\. The DB instance must use a security group that allows egress within the directory's VPC so the DB instance can communicate with the directory\.

When you use the console to create a DB instance, choose **Password and Kerberos authentication** in the **Database authentication** section\. Choose **Browse Directory** and then select the directory, or choose **Create a new directory**\.

![\[Kerberos authentication setting when creating a DB instance\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/kerberos-authentication.png)

When you use the console to modify or restore a DB instance, choose the directory in the **Kerberos authentication** section, or choose **Create a new directory**\.

![\[Kerberos authentication setting when modifying or restoring a DB instance\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/kerberos-auth-modify-restore.png)

 Use the CLI or RDS API to associate a DB instance with a directory\. The following parameters are required for the DB instance to be able to use the domain directory you created: 
+  For the `--domain` parameter, use the domain identifier \("d\-\*" identifier\) generated when you created the directory\. 
+  For the `--domain-iam-role-name` parameter, use the role you created that uses the managed IAM policy `AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess`\. 

 For example, the following CLI command modifies a DB instance to use a directory\. 

For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

```
aws rds modify-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \
    --domain d-ID \
    --domain-iam-role-name role-name
```

For Windows:

```
aws rds modify-db-instance ^
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance ^
    --domain d-ID ^
    --domain-iam-role-name role-name
```

**Important**  
If you modify a DB instance to enable Kerberos authentication, reboot the DB instance after making the change\.

### Step 5: Create Kerberos authentication MySQL logins<a name="mysql-kerberos-setting-up.create-logins"></a>

 Use the Amazon RDS master user credentials to connect to the MySQL DB instance as you do any other DB instance\. The DB instance is joined to the AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain\. Thus, you can provision MySQL logins and users from the Active Directory users in your domain\. Database permissions are managed through standard MySQL permissions that are granted to and revoked from these logins\. 

 You can allow an Active Directory user to authenticate with MySQL\. To do this, first use the Amazon RDS master user credentials to connect to the MySQL DB instance as with any other DB instance\. After you're logged in, create an externally authenticated user with PAM \(Pluggable Authentication Modules\) in MySQL as shown following\. 

```
CREATE USER 'testuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH 'auth_pam';
UPDATE mysql.user SET ssl_type = 'any' WHERE ssl_type = '' AND PLUGIN = 'auth_pam' and USER = 'testuser';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

 Replace `testuser` with the user name\. Users \(both humans and applications\) from your domain can now connect to the DB instance from a domain joined client machine using Kerberos authentication\. 

**Important**  
We strongly recommended that clients use SSL/TLS connections when using PAM authentication\. If they don't use SSL/TLS connections, the password might be sent as clear text in some cases\.

## Managing a DB instance in a domain<a name="mysql-kerberos-managing"></a>

 You can use the CLI or the RDS API to manage your DB instance and its relationship with your managed Active Directory\. For example, you can associate an Active Directory for Kerberos authentication and disassociate an Active Directory to disable Kerberos authentication\. You can also move a DB instance to be externally authenticated by one Active Directory to another\. 

 For example, using the Amazon RDS API, you can do the following: 
+  To reattempt enabling Kerberos authentication for a failed membership, use the `ModifyDBInstance` API operation and specify the current membership's directory ID\. 
+  To update the IAM role name for membership, use the `ModifyDBInstance` API operation and specify the current membership's directory ID and the new IAM role\. 
+  To disable Kerberos authentication on a DB instance, use the `ModifyDBInstance` API operation and specify `none` as the domain parameter\. 
+  To move a DB instance from one domain to another, use the `ModifyDBInstance` API operation and specify the domain identifier of the new domain as the domain parameter\. 
+  To list membership for each DB instance, use the `DescribeDBInstances` API operation\. 

### Understanding domain membership<a name="mysql-kerberos-managing.understanding"></a>

 After you create or modify your DB instance, it becomes a member of the domain\. You can view the status of the domain membership for the DB instance by running the [describe\-db\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.html) CLI command\. The status of the DB instance can be one of the following: 
+  `kerberos-enabled` – The DB instance has Kerberos authentication enabled\. 
+  `enabling-kerberos` – AWS is in the process of enabling Kerberos authentication on this DB instance\. 
+  `pending-enable-kerberos` – The enabling of Kerberos authentication is pending on this DB instance\. 
+  `pending-maintenance-enable-kerberos` – AWS will attempt to enable Kerberos authentication on the DB instance during the next scheduled maintenance window\. 
+  `pending-disable-kerberos` – The disabling of Kerberos authentication is pending on this DB instance\. 
+  `pending-maintenance-disable-kerberos` – AWS will attempt to disable Kerberos authentication on the DB instance during the next scheduled maintenance window\. 
+  `enable-kerberos-failed` – A configuration problem has prevented AWS from enabling Kerberos authentication on the DB instance\. Check and fix your configuration before reissuing the DB instance modify command\. 
+  `disabling-kerberos` – AWS is in the process of disabling Kerberos authentication on this DB instance\. 

 A request to enable Kerberos authentication can fail because of a network connectivity issue or an incorrect IAM role\. For example, suppose that you create a DB instance or modify an existing DB instance and the attempt to enable Kerberos authentication fails\. If this happens, re\-issue the modify command or modify the newly created DB instance to join the domain\. 

## Connecting to MySQL with Kerberos authentication<a name="mysql-kerberos-connecting"></a>

 To connect to MySQL with Kerberos authentication, you must log in using the Kerberos authentication type\. 

 To create a database user that you can connect to using Kerberos authentication, use an `IDENTIFIED WITH` clause on the `CREATE USER` statement\. For instructions, see [Step 5: Create Kerberos authentication MySQL logins](#mysql-kerberos-setting-up.create-logins)\. 

To avoid errors, use the MariaDB `mysql` client\. You can download MariaDB software at [https://downloads\.mariadb\.org/](https://downloads.mariadb.org/)\.

At a command prompt, connect to one of the endpoints associated with your MySQL DB instance\. Follow the general procedures in [Connecting to a DB instance running the MySQL database engine](USER_ConnectToInstance.md)\. When you're prompted for the password, enter the Kerberos password associated with that user name\.

## Restoring a MySQL DB instance and adding it to a domain<a name="mysql-kerberos-restoring"></a>

 You can restore a DB snapshot or complete a point\-in\-time restore for a MySQL DB instance and then add it to a domain\. After the DB instance is restored, modify the DB instance using the process explained in [Step 4: Create or modify a MySQL DB instance](#mysql-kerberos-setting-up.create-modify) to add the DB instance to a domain\. 

## Kerberos authentication MySQL limitations<a name="mysql-kerberos.limitations"></a>

 The following limitations apply to Kerberos authentication for MySQL: 
+  A Managed Active Directory that has been shared with you isn't supported\. 
+  Kerberos authentication is supported for the following Amazon RDS for MySQL versions: 
  + Amazon RDS for MySQL 8\.0\.13 and higher versions
  + Amazon RDS for MySQL 5\.7\.24 and higher versions
+  You must reboot the DB instance after enabling the feature\. 
+  The domain name length can't be longer than 61 characters\. 
+  You can't enable Kerberos authentication and IAM authentication at the same time\. Choose one authentication method or the other for your MySQL DB instance\. 
+  Don't modify the DB instance port after enabling the feature\. 
+  Don't use Kerberos authentication with read replicas\. 
+  To delete a DB instance with this feature enabled, first disable the feature\. To do this, use the `modify-db-instance` CLI command for the DB instance and specify `none` for the `--domain` parameter\. 

   If you use the CLI or RDS API to delete a DB instance with this feature enabled, expect a delay\.

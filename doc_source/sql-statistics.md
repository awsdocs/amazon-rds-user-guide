# SQL statistics for Performance Insights<a name="sql-statistics"></a>

*SQL statistics* are performance\-related metrics about SQL queries that are collected by Performance Insights\. Performance Insights gathers statistics for each second that a query is running and for each SQL call\. The SQL statistics are an average for the selected time range\.

A SQL digest is a composite of all queries having a given pattern but not necessarily having the same literal values\. The digest replaces literal values with a question mark\. For example, `SELECT * FROM emp WHERE lname= ?`\. This digest might consist of the following child queries:

```
           SELECT * FROM emp WHERE lname = 'Sanchez'
           SELECT * FROM emp WHERE lname = 'Olagappan'
           SELECT * FROM emp WHERE lname = 'Wu'
```

All engines support SQL statistics for digest queries\.

# Resetting the `db_owner` Role Password<a name="Appendix.SQLServer.CommonDBATasks.ResetPassword"></a>

If you lock yourself out of the `db_owner` role on your Microsoft SQL Server database, you can reset the `db_owner` role password by modifying the DB instance master password\. By changing the DB instance master password, you can regain access to the DB instance, access databases using the modified password for the `db_owner`, and restore privileges for the `db_owner` role that may have been accidentally revoked\. You can change the DB instance password by using the Amazon RDS console, the AWS CLI command [modify\-db\-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.html), or by using the [ModifyDBInstance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyDBInstance.html) operation\. For more information about modifying a DB instance, see [Modifying an Amazon RDS DB Instance](Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.md)\.

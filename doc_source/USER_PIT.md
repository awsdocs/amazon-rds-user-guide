# Restoring a DB Instance to a Specified Time<a name="USER_PIT"></a>

You can restore a DB instance to a specific point in time, creating a new DB instance\. When you restore a DB instance to a point in time, the default DB security group is applied to the new DB instance\. If you need custom DB security groups applied to your DB instance, you must apply them explicitly using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI `modify-db-instance` command, or the Amazon RDS API `ModifyDBInstance` operation after the DB instance is available\.

RDS uploads transaction logs for DB instances to Amazon S3 every 5 minutes\. To determine the latest restorable time for a DB instance, use the AWS CLI [ describe\-db\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.html) command and look at the value returned in the `LatestRestorableTime` field for the DB instance\. In the AWS Management Console, this property is visible as the **Latest restore time** for the DB instance\. You can restore to any point in time during your backup retention period\.

Several of the database engines used by Amazon RDS have special considerations when restoring from a point in time\. When you restore an Oracle DB instance to a point in time, you can specify a different Oracle DB engine, license model, and DBName \(SID\) to be used by the new DB instance\. When you restore a SQL Server DB instance to a point in time, each database within that instance is restored to a point in time within 1 second of each other database within the instance\. Transactions that span multiple databases within the instance may be restored inconsistently\. Also, for a SQL Server DB instance, the `OFFLINE`, `EMERGENCY`, and `SINGLE_USER` modes are not currently supported\. Setting any database into one of these modes will cause the latest restorable time to stop moving ahead for the whole instance\.

Some actions, such as changing the recovery model of a SQL Server database, can break the sequence of logs that are used for point\-in\-time recovery\. In some cases, Amazon RDS can detect this issue and the latest restorable time is prevented from moving forward; in other cases, such as when a SQL Server database uses the `BULK_LOGGED` recovery model, the break in log sequence is not detected\. It may not be possible to restore a SQL Server DB instance to a point in time if there is a break in the log sequence\. For these reasons, Amazon RDS does not support changing the recovery model of SQL Server databases\. 

You can restore a DB instance to a point in time using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API\.

## Console<a name="USER_PIT.CON"></a>

**To restore a DB instance to a specified time**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**\.

1. Choose the DB instance that you want to restore\.

1. For **Actions**, choose **Restore to point in time**\.

   The **Launch DB Instance** window appears\.

1. Choose **Latest restorable time** to restore to the latest possible time, or choose **Custom** to choose a time\.

   If you chose **Custom**, enter the date and time that you want to restore the instance to\.

1. For **DB instance identifier**, enter the name of the restored DB instance, and then complete the other options\.

1. Choose **Launch DB Instance**\.

## AWS CLI<a name="USER_PIT.CLI"></a>

To restore a DB instance to a specified time, use the AWS CLI command [ `restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time.html) to create a new DB instance\.

**Example**  
For Linux, OS X, or Unix:  

```
1. aws rds restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time \
2.     --source-db-instance-identifier mysourcedbinstance \
3.     --target-db-instance-identifier mytargetdbinstance \
4.     --restore-time 2017-10-14T23:45:00.000Z
```
For Windows:  

```
1. aws rds restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time ^
2.     --source-db-instance-identifier mysourcedbinstance ^
3.     --target-db-instance-identifier mytargetdbinstance ^
4.     --restore-time 2017-10-14T23:45:00.000Z
```

## RDS API<a name="USER_PIT.API"></a>

To restore a DB instance to a specified time, call the Amazon RDS API [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime.html) operation with the following parameters:
+ `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`
+ `TargetDBInstanceIdentifier`
+ `RestoreTime`

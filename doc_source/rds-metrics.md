## Amazon CloudWatch instance\-level metrics for Amazon RDS<a name="rds-cw-metrics-instance"></a>

The `AWS/RDS` namespace in Amazon CloudWatch includes the following instance\-level metrics\.

**Note**  
The Amazon RDS console might display metrics in units that are different from the units sent to Amazon CloudWatch\. For example, the Amazon RDS console might display a metric in megabytes \(MB\), while the metric is sent to Amazon CloudWatch in bytes\.


| Metric | Console name | Description | Units | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| BinLogDiskUsage |   **Binary Log Disk Usage \(MB\)**   |  The amount of disk space occupied by binary logs\. If automatic backups are enabled for MySQL and MariaDB instances, including read replicas, binary logs are created\.  |  Bytes  | 
| BurstBalance |   **Burst Balance \(Percent\)**   |  The percent of General Purpose SSD \(gp2\) burst\-bucket I/O credits available\.   |  Percent  | 
| CheckpointLag | Checkpoint Lag \(Milliseconds\) |  The amount of time since the most recent checkpoint\. Applies to only RDS for PostgreSQL\.  |  Seconds  | 
|  `ConnectionAttempts`  |  **Connection Attempts \(Count\)**  |  The number of attempts to connect to an instance, whether successful or not\.  |  Count  | 
| CPUUtilization |   **CPU Utilization \(Percent\)**   |  The percentage of CPU utilization\.  |  Percent  | 
| CPUCreditUsage |  **CPU Credit Usage \(Count\)**   |  \(T2 instances\) The number of CPU credits spent by the instance for CPU utilization\. One CPU credit equals one vCPU running at 100 percent utilization for one minute or an equivalent combination of vCPUs, utilization, and time\. For example, you might have one vCPU running at 50 percent utilization for two minutes or two vCPUs running at 25 percent utilization for two minutes\. CPU credit metrics are available at a five\-minute frequency only\. If you specify a period greater than five minutes, use the `Sum` statistic instead of the `Average` statistic\.  |  Credits \(vCPU\-minutes\)  | 
| CPUCreditBalance |  **CPU Credit Balance \(Count\)**   |  \(T2 instances\) The number of earned CPU credits that an instance has accrued since it was launched or started\. For T2 Standard, the `CPUCreditBalance` also includes the number of launch credits that have been accrued\. Credits are accrued in the credit balance after they are earned, and removed from the credit balance when they are spent\. The credit balance has a maximum limit, determined by the instance size\. After the limit is reached, any new credits that are earned are discarded\. For T2 Standard, launch credits don't count towards the limit\. The credits in the `CPUCreditBalance` are available for the instance to spend to burst beyond its baseline CPU utilization\. When an instance is running, credits in the `CPUCreditBalance` don't expire\. When the instance stops, the `CPUCreditBalance` does not persist, and all accrued credits are lost\. CPU credit metrics are available at a five\-minute frequency only\. Launch credits work the same way in Amazon RDS as they do in Amazon EC2\. For more information, see [Launch credits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances-standard-mode-concepts.html#launch-credits) in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide for Linux Instances*\.  |  Credits \(vCPU\-minutes\)  | 
| DatabaseConnections |  **DB Connections \(Count\)**   |  The number of client network connections to the database instance\. The number of database sessions can be higher than the metric value because the metric value doesn't include the following: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-metrics.html)  |  Count  | 
| DiskQueueDepth |  **Queue Depth \(Count\)**   |  The number of outstanding I/Os \(read/write requests\) waiting to access the disk\.  |  Count  | 
| EBSByteBalance% |  **EBS Byte Balance \(Percent\)**  |  The percentage of throughput credits remaining in the burst bucket of your RDS database\. This metric is available for basic monitoring only\.  The metric value is based on the throughput and IOPS of all volumes, including the root volume, rather than on only those volumes containing database files\. To find the instance sizes that support this metric, see the instance sizes with an asterisk \(\*\) in the [EBS optimized by default](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-optimized.html#current) table in *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\. The `Sum` statistic is not applicable to this metric\.  |  Percent  | 
| EBSIOBalance% |  **EBS IO Balance \(Percent\)**  |  The percentage of I/O credits remaining in the burst bucket of your RDS database\. This metric is available for basic monitoring only\. The metric value is based on the throughput and IOPS of all volumes, including the root volume, rather than on only those volumes containing database files\. To find the instance sizes that support this metric, see the instance sizes with an asterisk \(\*\) in the [EBS optimized by default](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-optimized.html#current) table in *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\. The `Sum` statistic is not applicable to this metric\. This metric is different from `BurstBalance`\.

| FailedSQLServerAgentJobsCount  |   **Failed SQL Server Agent Jobs Count \(Count/Minute\)**   |  The number of failed Microsoft SQL Server Agent jobs during the last minute\.  |  Count/Minute  | 
| FreeableMemory |   **Freeable Memory \(MB\)**   |  The amount of available random access memory\.  For MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL DB instances, this metric reports the value of the `MemAvailable` field of `/proc/meminfo`\.    |  Bytes  | 
| FreeLocalStorage |   **Free Local Storage \(MB\)**   |  The amount of available local storage space\. This metric only applies to DB instance classes with NVMe SSD instance store volumes\.

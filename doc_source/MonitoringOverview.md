# Overview of monitoring Amazon RDS<a name="MonitoringOverview"></a>

Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of Amazon RDS and your AWS solutions\. To more easily debug multi\-point failures, we recommend that you collect monitoring data from all parts of your AWS solution\.

## Monitoring plan<a name="MonitoringOverview.plan"></a>

Before you start monitoring Amazon RDS, we recommend that you create a monitoring plan\. This plan should answer the following questions:
+ What are your monitoring goals?
+ Which resources will you monitor?
+ How often will you monitor these resources?
+ Which monitoring tools will you use?
+ Who will perform the monitoring tasks?
+ Whom should be notified when something goes wrong?

## Performance baseline<a name="MonitoringOverview.baseline"></a>

To achieve your monitoring goals, you need to establish a baseline\. To do this, measure performance under different load conditions at various times in your Amazon RDS environment\. You can monitor metrics such as the following:
+ Network throughput
+ Client connections
+ I/O for read, write, or metadata operations
+ Burst credit balances for your DB instances

We recommend that you store historical performance data for Amazon RDS\. Using the stored data, you can compare current performance against past trends\. You can also distinguish normal performance patterns from anomalies, and devise methods to address issues\.

## Performance guidelines<a name="MonitoringOverview.guidelines"></a>

In general, acceptable values for performance metrics depend on what your application is doing relative to your baseline\. Investigate consistent or trending variances from your baseline\. The following metrics are often the source of performance issues:
+  **High CPU or RAM consumption** – High values for CPU or RAM consumption might be appropriate, if they're in keeping with your goals for your application \(like throughput or concurrency\) and are expected\. 
+  **Disk space consumption** – Investigate disk space consumption if space used is consistently at or above 85 percent of the total disk space\. See if it is possible to delete data from the instance or archive data to a different system to free up space\. 
+  **Network traffic** – For network traffic, talk with your system administrator to understand what expected throughput is for your domain network and internet connection\. Investigate network traffic if throughput is consistently lower than expected\. 
+  **Database connections** – If you see high numbers of user connections and also decreases in instance performance and response time, consider constraining database connections\. The best number of user connections for your DB instance varies based on your instance class and the complexity of the operations being performed\. To determine the number of database connections, associate your DB instance with a parameter group where the `User Connections` parameter is set to a value other than 0 \(unlimited\)\. You can either use an existing parameter group or create a new one\. For more information, see [Working with DB parameter groups](USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.md)\. 
+  **IOPS metrics** – The expected values for IOPS metrics depend on disk specification and server configuration, so use your baseline to know what is typical\. Investigate if values are consistently different than your baseline\. For best IOPS performance, make sure that your typical working set fits into memory to minimize read and write operations\. 

When performance falls outside your established baseline, you might need to make changes to optimize your database availability for your workload\. For example, you might need to change the instance class of your DB instance\. Or you might need to change the number of DB instances and read replicas that are available for clients\. 

## Monitoring tools<a name="MonitoringOverview.tools"></a>

AWS provides various tools that you can use to monitor Amazon RDS\. You can configure some of these tools to do the monitoring for you, and other tools require manual intervention\. 

### Automated monitoring tools<a name="MonitoringOverview.tools.automated"></a>

We recommend that you automate monitoring tasks as much as possible\. 

#### Amazon RDS reporting tools<a name="MonitoringOverview.tools.automated.rds"></a>

You can use the following automated tools to watch Amazon RDS and report when something is wrong:
+ **Amazon RDS events** – Subscribe to Amazon RDS events to be notified when changes occur with a DB instance, DB snapshot, DB parameter group, or DB security group\. For more information, see [Using Amazon RDS event notification](USER_Events.md)\.
+ **Database log files** – View, download, or watch database log files using the Amazon RDS console or Amazon RDS API operations\. You can also query some database log files that are loaded into database tables\. For more information, see [Amazon RDS database log files](USER_LogAccess.md)\.
+ **Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring** — Look at metrics in real time for the operating system\. For more information, see [Enhanced Monitoring](USER_Monitoring.OS.md)\.
+ **Amazon RDS Performance Insights** — Assess the load on your database, and determine when and where to take action\. For more information, see [Using Amazon RDS Performance Insights](USER_PerfInsights.md)\.
+ **Amazon RDS recommendations** — Look at automated recommendations for database resources, such as DB instances, read replicas, and DB parameter groups\. For more information, see [Using Amazon RDS recommendations](USER_Recommendations.md)\.

#### Integrated monitoring tools<a name="MonitoringOverview.tools.automated.integrated"></a>

Amazon RDS integrates with Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon EventBridge, and AWS CloudTrail for additional monitoring capabilities\. 
+ **Amazon CloudWatch** – This service monitors your AWS resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time\. You can use the following Amazon CloudWatch features with Amazon RDS:
  + **Amazon CloudWatch metrics** – Amazon RDS automatically sends metrics to CloudWatch every minute for each active database\. You don't get additional charges for Amazon RDS metrics in CloudWatch\. For more information, see [Viewing DB instance metrics](#USER_Monitoring)\.
  + **Amazon CloudWatch alarms** – You can watch a single Amazon RDS metric over a specific time period\. You can then perform one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a threshold that you set\. For more information, see [Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch](#monitoring-cloudwatch)\.
+ **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** – Most DB engines enable you to monitor, store, and access your database log files in CloudWatch Logs\. For more information, see [Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/)\.
+ **Amazon EventBridge** – is a serverless event bus service that makes it easy to connect your applications with data from a variety of sources\. EventBridge delivers a stream of real\-time data from your own applications, Software\-as\-a\-Service \(SaaS\) applications, and AWS services and routes that data to targets such as Lambda\. This enables you to monitor events that happen in services, and build event\-driven architectures\. For more information, see [Getting CloudWatch Events and Amazon EventBridge events for Amazon RDS](rds-cloud-watch-events.md)\.
+ **AWS CloudTrail** – You can view a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in Amazon RDS\. CloudTrail captures all API calls for Amazon RDS as events\. These captures include calls from the Amazon RDS console and from code calls to the Amazon RDS API operations\. If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for Amazon RDS\. If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in **Event history**\. For more information, see [Working with AWS CloudTrail and Amazon RDS ](logging-using-cloudtrail.md)\.

### Manual monitoring tools<a name="monitoring_manual_tools"></a>

You need to manually monitor those items that the CloudWatch alarms don't cover\. The Amazon RDS, CloudWatch, AWS Trusted Advisor and other AWS console dashboards provide an at\-a\-glance view of the state of your AWS environment\. We recommend that you also check the log files on your DB instance\.
+ From the Amazon RDS console, you can monitor the following items for your resources:
  + The number of connections to a DB instance
  + The amount of read and write operations to a DB instance
  + The amount of storage that a DB instance is currently using
  + The amount of memory and CPU being used for a DB instance
  + The amount of network traffic to and from a DB instance
+ From the Trusted Advisor dashboard, you can review the following cost optimization, security, fault tolerance, and performance improvement checks:
  + Amazon RDS Idle DB Instances
  + Amazon RDS Security Group Access Risk
  + Amazon RDS Backups
  + Amazon RDS Multi\-AZ

  For more information on these checks, see [Trusted Advisor best practices \(checks\)](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/best-practices/)\.
+ CloudWatch home page shows:
  + Current alarms and status
  + Graphs of alarms and resources
  + Service health status

  In addition, you can use CloudWatch to do the following: 
  + Create [customized dashboards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/CloudWatch_Dashboards.html) to monitor the services that you care about\.
  + Graph metric data to troubleshoot issues and discover trends\.
  + Search and browse all your AWS resource metrics\.
  + Create and edit alarms to be notified of problems\.

## Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch<a name="monitoring-cloudwatch"></a>

You can monitor DB instances using Amazon CloudWatch, which collects and processes raw data from Amazon RDS into readable, near real\-time metrics\. By default, Amazon RDS metric data is automatically sent to CloudWatch in 1\-minute periods\. For more information about CloudWatch, see [ What is Amazon CloudWatch?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

Data points with a period of 60 seconds \(1 minute\) are available for 15 days\. This means that you can access historical information and gain a better perspective on how your web application or service is performing\. For more information about CloudWatch metrics retention, see [Metrics retention](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudwatch_concepts.html#metrics-retention) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

**Note**  
If you are using Amazon RDS Performance Insights, additional metrics are available\. For more information, see [Performance Insights metrics published to Amazon CloudWatch](USER_PerfInsights.Cloudwatch.md)\.

### Amazon RDS metrics and dimensions<a name="metrics_dimensions"></a>

When you use Amazon RDS resources, Amazon RDS sends metrics and dimensions to Amazon CloudWatch every minute\. You can use the following procedures to view the metrics for Amazon RDS\.

**To view metrics using the Amazon CloudWatch console**

Metrics are grouped first by the service namespace, and then by the various dimension combinations within each namespace\.

  ```

#### Amazon RDS Metrics<a name="rds-metrics"></a>

The `AWS/RDS` namespace includes the following metrics\.

**Note**  
The Amazon RDS console might display metrics in units that are different from the units sent to Amazon CloudWatch\. For example, the Amazon RDS console might display a metric in megabytes \(MB\), while the metric is sent to Amazon CloudWatch in bytes\.


| Metric | Console name | Description |

The credit balance has a maximum limit, determined by the instance size\. After the limit is reached, any new credits that are earned are discarded\. For T2 Standard, launch credits don't count towards the limit\.The credits in the `CPUCreditBalance` are available for the instance to spend to burst beyond its baseline CPU utilization\.When an instance is running, credits in the `CPUCreditBalance` don't expire\. When the instance stops, the `CPUCreditBalance` does not persist, and all accrued credits are lost\.CPU credit metrics are available at a five\-minute frequency only\.Units: Credits \(vCPU\-minutes\) | 
| DatabaseConnections |   **DB Connections \(Count\)**   |  The number of database connections in use\. The metric value might not include broken database connections that haven't been cleaned up by your database yet\. So, the number of database connections recorded by your database might be higher than the metric value\. Units: Count  | 
| DiskQueueDepth |   **Queue Depth \(Count\)**   |  The number of outstanding I/Os \(read/write requests\) waiting to access the disk\. Units: Count  |

#### Amazon RDS Dimensions<a name="dimensions"></a>

You can filter Amazon RDS metrics data by using any dimension in the following table\.


|  Dimension  |  Description  | 
| --- | --- | 
|  DBInstanceIdentifier  |  This dimension filters the data that you request for a specific DB instance\.  | 
|  DBClusterIdentifier  |  This dimension filters the data that you request for a specific Amazon Aurora DB cluster\.  | 
|  DBClusterIdentifier, Role  |  This dimension filters the data that you request for a specific Aurora DB cluster, aggregating the metric by instance role \(WRITER/READER\)\. For example, you can aggregate metrics for all READER instances that belong to a cluster\.  | 
|  DatabaseClass  |  This dimension filters the data that you request for all instances in a database class\. For example, you can aggregate metrics for all instances that belong to the database class `db.r5.large`\.  | 
|  EngineName  |  This dimension filters the data that you request for the identified engine name only\. For example, you can aggregate metrics for all instances that have the engine name `mysql`\.  | 
|  SourceRegion  |  This dimension filters the data that you request for the specified region only\. For example, you can aggregate metrics for all instances in the `us-east-1` Region\.  | 

#### Creating CloudWatch alarms to monitor Amazon RDS<a name="creating_alarms"></a>

You can create a CloudWatch alarm that sends an Amazon SNS message when the alarm changes state\. An alarm watches a single metric over a time period that you secify\. The alarm can also perform one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods\. The action is a notification sent to an Amazon SNS topic or Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling policy\.

Alarms invoke actions for sustained state changes only\. CloudWatch alarms don't invoke actions simply because they are in a particular state\. The state must have changed and have been maintained for a specified number of time periods\. The following procedures show how to create alarms for Amazon RDS\.

**To set alarms using the CloudWatch console**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. Choose **Alarms** and then choose **Create Alarm**\. Doing this launches the Create Alarm Wizard\. 

1. Choose **RDS Metrics** and scroll through the Amazon RDS metrics to find the metric that you want to place an alarm on\. To display just Amazon RDS metrics, search for the identifier of your resource\. Choose the metric to create an alarm on and then choose **Next**\.

1. Enter **Name**, **Description**, and **Whenever** values for the metric\. 

1. If you want CloudWatch to send you an email when the alarm state is reached, for **Whenever this alarm**, choose **State is ALARM**\. For **Send notification to**, choose an existing SNS topic\. If you choose **Create topic**, you can set the name and email addresses for a new email subscription list\. This list is saved and appears in the field for future alarms\. 
**Note**  
If you use **Create topic** to create a new Amazon SNS topic, the email addresses must be verified before they receive notifications\. Emails are only sent when the alarm enters an alarm state\. If this alarm state change happens before the email addresses are verified, the addresses don't receive a notification\.

1. Preview the alarm that you're about to create in the **Alarm Preview** area, and then choose **Create Alarm**\. 

**To set an alarm using the AWS CLI**
+ Call [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/put-metric-alarm.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/put-metric-alarm.html)\. For more information, see *[AWS CLI Command Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/)*\.

**To set an alarm using the CloudWatch API**
+ Call [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_PutMetricAlarm.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_PutMetricAlarm.html)\. For more information, see *[Amazon CloudWatch API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/)* 

## Publishing database engine logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs<a name="publishing_cloudwatchlogs"></a>

You can configure your Amazon RDS database engine to publish log data to a log group in Amazon CloudWatch Logs\. With CloudWatch Logs, you can perform real\-time analysis of the log data, and use CloudWatch to create alarms and view metrics\. You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log records in highly durable storage, which you can manage with the CloudWatch Logs Agent\. For example, you can determine when to rotate log records from a host to the log service, so you can access the raw logs when you need to\. 

For engine\-specific information, see the following topics:
+ [Publishing MariaDB logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs](USER_LogAccess.Concepts.MariaDB.md#USER_LogAccess.MariaDB.PublishtoCloudWatchLogs)
+ [Publishing MySQL logs to CloudWatch Logs](USER_LogAccess.Concepts.MySQL.md#USER_LogAccess.MySQLDB.PublishtoCloudWatchLogs)
+ [Publishing Oracle logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs](USER_LogAccess.Concepts.Oracle.md#USER_LogAccess.Oracle.PublishtoCloudWatchLogs)
+ [Publishing PostgreSQL logs to CloudWatch Logs](USER_LogAccess.Concepts.PostgreSQL.md#USER_LogAccess.PostgreSQL.PublishtoCloudWatchLogs)
+ [Publishing SQL Server logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs](USER_LogAccess.Concepts.SQLServer.md#USER_LogAccess.SQLServer.PublishtoCloudWatchLogs)

**Note**  
Before you enable log data publishing, make sure that you have a service\-linked role in AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)\. For more information about service\-linked roles, see [Using service\-linked roles for Amazon RDS](UsingWithRDS.IAM.ServiceLinkedRoles.md)\.

### Configuring CloudWatch log integration<a name="integrating_cloudwatchlogs.configure"></a>

To publish your database log files to CloudWatch Logs, choose which logs to publish\. Make this choice in the **Advanced Settings** section when you create a new DB instance\. You can also modify an existing DB instance to begin publishing\. 

![\[Add CloudWatch Logs\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/AddCWLogs.png)

 After you have enabled publishing, Amazon RDS continuously streams all of the DB instance log records to a log group\. For example, you have a log group `/aws/rds/instance/log type` for each type of log that you publish\. This log group is in the same AWS Region as the database instance that generates the log\.

 After you have published log records, you can use CloudWatch Logs to search and filter the records\. For more information about searching and filtering logs, see [Searching and filtering log data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/MonitoringLogData.html)\. 

### Viewing DB instance metrics<a name="USER_Monitoring"></a>

Amazon RDS provides metrics so that you can monitor the health of your DB instances\. You can monitor both DB instance metrics and operating system \(OS\) metrics\.

Following, you can find details about how to view metrics for your DB instance using the RDS console and CloudWatch\. For information on monitoring metrics for your DB instance's operating system in real time using CloudWatch Logs, see [Enhanced Monitoring](USER_Monitoring.OS.md)\.

#### Viewing metrics by using the console<a name="USER_Monitoring.CON"></a>

**To view DB and OS metrics for a DB instance**

1. Choose the name of the DB instance that you need information about to show its details\.

1. Choose the **Monitoring** tab\.

1. For **Monitoring**, choose the option for how you want to view your metrics from these:
   + **CloudWatch** – Shows a summary of DB instance metrics available from Amazon CloudWatch\. Each metric includes a graph showing the metric monitored over a specific time span\.
   + **Enhanced monitoring** – Shows a summary of OS metrics available for a DB instance with Enhanced Monitoring enabled\. Each metric includes a graph showing the metric monitored over a specific time span\.
   + **OS Process list** – Shows details for each process running in the selected instance\.
   + **Performance Insights** – Opens the Amazon RDS Performance Insights console for your DB instance\.  
![\[RDS metrics viewing options\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/metrics0.png)
**Tip**  
To choose the time range of the metrics represented by the graphs, you can use the time range list\.  
To bring up a more detailed view, you can choose any graph\. You can also apply metric\-specific filters to the data\. 

#### Viewing DB instance metrics with the CLI or API<a name="USER_Monitoring.DB"></a>

Amazon RDS integrates with CloudWatch metrics to provide a variety of DB instance metrics\. You can view CloudWatch metrics using the RDS console, AWS CLI, or API\.

 For a complete list of Amazon RDS metrics, go to [ Amazon RDS dimensions and metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/rds-metricscollected.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

# DB Instance Status<a name="Overview.DBInstance.Status"></a>

The status of a DB instance indicates the health of the DB instance\. You can view the status of a DB instance by using the Amazon RDS console, the AWS CLI command [describe\-db\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-instances.html), or the API operation [DescribeDBInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBInstances.html)\. 

**Note**  
Amazon RDS also uses another status called *maintenance status*, which is shown in the **Maintenance** column of the Amazon RDS console\. This value indicates the status of any maintenance patches that need to be applied to a DB instance\. Maintenance status is independent of DB instance status\. For more information on *maintenance status*, see [Applying Updates for a DB Instance](USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.md#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.OSUpgrades)\. 

Find the possible status values for DB instances in the following table, which also shows how you are billed for each status\. It shows if you will be billed for the DB instance and storage, billed only for storage, or not billed\. For all DB instance statuses, you are always billed for backup usage\.


| DB Instance Status | Billed  | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  **available**  | Billed |  The DB instance is healthy and available\.  | 
|  **backing\-up**  | Billed |  The DB instance is currently being backed up\.  | 
| backtracking | Billed |  The DB instance is currently being backtracked\. This status only applies to Aurora MySQL\.  | 
|  **configuring\-enhanced\-monitoring**  | Billed |  Enhanced Monitoring is being enabled or disabled for this DB instance\.  | 
|  **configuring\-iam\-database\-auth**  | Billed |  AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) database authentication is being enabled or disabled for this DB instance\.  | 
|  **configuring\-log\-exports**  | Billed |  Publishing log files to Amazon CloudWatch Logs is being enabled or disabled for this DB instance\.  | 
|  **converting\-to\-vpc**  | Billed |  The DB instance is being converted from a DB instance that is not in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\) to a DB instance that is in an Amazon VPC\.  | 
|  **creating**  | Not billed |  The DB instance is being created\. The DB instance is inaccessible while it is being created\.   | 
|  **deleting**  | Not billed |  The DB instance is being deleted\.  | 
|  **failed**  | Not billed |  The DB instance has failed and Amazon RDS can't recover it\. Perform a point\-in\-time restore to the latest restorable time of the DB instance to recover the data\.   | 
|  **inaccessible\-encryption\-credentials**  | Not billed |  The AWS KMS key used to encrypt or decrypt the DB instance can't be accessed\.   | 
|  **incompatible\-network**  | Not billed |  Amazon RDS is attempting to perform a recovery action on a DB instance but can't do so because the VPC is in a state that prevents the action from being completed\. This status can occur if, for example, all available IP addresses in a subnet are in use and Amazon RDS can't get an IP address for the DB instance\.   | 
|  **incompatible\-option\-group**  | Billed |  Amazon RDS attempted to apply an option group change but can't do so, and Amazon RDS can't roll back to the previous option group state\. For more information, check the **Recent Events** list for the DB instance\. This status can occur if, for example, the option group contains an option such as TDE and the DB instance doesn't contain encrypted information\.   | 
|  **incompatible\-parameters**  | Billed |  Amazon RDS can't start the DB instance because the parameters specified in the DB instance's DB parameter group aren't compatible with the DB instance\. Revert the parameter changes or make them compatible with the DB instance to regain access to your DB instance\. For more information about the incompatible parameters, check the **Recent Events** list for the DB instance\.   | 
|  **incompatible\-restore**  | Not billed |  Amazon RDS can't do a point\-in\-time restore\. Common causes for this status include using temp tables, using MyISAM tables with MySQL, or using Aria tables with MariaDB\.   | 
|  **maintenance**  | Billed |  Amazon RDS is applying a maintenance update to the DB instance\. This status is used for instance\-level maintenance that RDS schedules well in advance\.   | 
|  **modifying**  | Billed |  The DB instance is being modified because of a customer request to modify the DB instance\.   | 
|  **moving\-to\-vpc**  | Billed |  The DB instance is being moved to a new Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\)\.  | 
|  **rebooting**  | Billed |  The DB instance is being rebooted because of a customer request or an Amazon RDS process that requires the rebooting of the DB instance\.  | 
|  **renaming**  | Billed |  The DB instance is being renamed because of a customer request to rename it\.   | 
|  **resetting\-master\-credentials**  | Billed |  The master credentials for the DB instance are being reset because of a customer request to reset them\.  | 
|  **restore\-error**  | Billed |  The DB instance encountered an error attempting to restore to a point\-in\-time or from a snapshot\.  | 
|  **starting**  | Billed for storage |  The DB instance is starting\.  | 
|  **stopped**  | Billed for storage |  The DB instance is stopped\.  | 
|  **stopping**  | Billed for storage |  The DB instance is being stopped\.  | 
|  **storage\-full**  | Billed |  The DB instance has reached its storage capacity allocation\. This is a critical status, and we recommend that you fix this issue immediately\. To do so, scale up your storage by modifying the DB instance\. To avoid this situation, set Amazon CloudWatch alarms to warn you when storage space is getting low\.   | 
|  **storage\-optimization**  | Billed |  Your DB instance is being modified to change the storage size or type\. The DB instance is fully operational\. However, while the status of your DB instance is **storage\-optimization**, you can't request any changes to the storage of your DB instance\. The storage optimization process is usually short, but can sometimes take up to and even beyond 24 hours\.   | 
|  **upgrading**  | Billed |  The database engine version is being upgraded\.   |

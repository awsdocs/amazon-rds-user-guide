# Working with Option Groups<a name="USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups"></a>

Some DB engines offer additional features that make it easier to manage data and databases, and to provide additional security for your database\. Amazon RDS uses option groups to enable and configure these features\. An *option group* can specify features, called options, that are available for a particular Amazon RDS DB instance\. Options can have settings that specify how the option works\. When you associate a DB instance with an option group, the specified options and option settings are enabled for that DB instance\. 

 Amazon RDS supports options for the following database engines: 


****  

| Database Engine | Relevant Documentation | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `MariaDB`  |  [Options for MariaDB Database Engine](Appendix.MariaDB.Options.md)  | 
|  `Microsoft SQL Server`  |  [Options for the Microsoft SQL Server Database Engine](Appendix.SQLServer.Options.md)  | 
|  `MySQL`  |  [Options for MySQL DB Instances](Appendix.MySQL.Options.md)  | 
|  `Oracle`  |  [Options for Oracle DB Instances](Appendix.Oracle.Options.md)  | 

## Option Groups Overview<a name="Overview.OptionGroups"></a>

Amazon RDS provides an empty default option group for each new DB instance\. You cannot modify this default option group, but any new option group that you create derives its settings from the default option group\. To apply an option to a DB instance, you must do the following: 

1. Create a new option group, or copy or modify an existing option group\.

1. Add one or more options to the option group\.

1. Associate the option group with the DB instance\.

Both DB instances and DB snapshots can be associated with an option group\. In some cases, you might restore from a DB snapshot or perform a point\-in\-time restore for a DB instance\. In these cases, the option group associated with the DB snapshot or DB instance is, by default, associated with the restored DB instance\. You can associate a different option group with a restored DB instance\. However, the new option group must contain any persistent or permanent options that were included in the original option group\. Persistent and permanent options are described following\.

Options require additional memory to run on a DB instance\. Thus, you might need to launch a larger instance to use them, depending on your current use of your DB instance\. For example, Oracle Enterprise Manager Database Control uses about 300 MB of RAM\. If you enable this option for a small DB instance, you might encounter performance problems or out\-of\-memory errors\.

### Persistent and Permanent Options<a name="Overview.OptionGroups.Permanent"></a>

Two types of options, persistent and permanent, require special consideration when you add them to an option group\. 

Persistent options can't be removed from an option group while DB instances are associated with the option group\. An example of a persistent option is the TDE option for Microsoft SQL Server transparent data encryption \(TDE\)\. You must disassociate all DB instances from the option group before a persistent option can be removed from the option group\. In some cases, you might restore or perform a point\-in\-time restore from a DB snapshot\. In these cases, if the option group associated with that DB snapshot contains a persistent option, you can only associate the restored DB instance with that option group\. 

Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced Security TDE, can never be removed from an option group\. You can change the option group of a DB instance that is using the permanent option\. However, the option group associated with the DB instance must include the same permanent option\. In some cases, you might restore or perform a point\-in\-time restore from a DB snapshot\. In these cases, if the option group associated with that DB snapshot contains a permanent option, you can only associate the restored DB instance with an option group with that permanent option\.

For Oracle DB instances, you can copy shared DB snapshots that have the options `Timezone` or `OLS` \(or both\)\. To do so, specify a target option group that includes these options when you copy the DB snapshot\. The OLS option is permanent and persistent only for Oracle DB instances running Oracle version 12\.2 or higher\. For more information about these options, see [Oracle Time Zone](Appendix.Oracle.Options.Timezone.md) and [Oracle Label Security](Oracle.Options.OLS.md)\.

### VPC and Platform Considerations<a name="Overview.OptionGroups.Platform"></a>

When an option group is assigned to a DB instance, it is linked to the platform that the DB instance is on\. That platform can either be a VPC supported by the Amazon VPC service, or EC2\-Classic \(non\-VPC\) supported by the Amazon EC2 service\. For details on these two platforms, see [Amazon EC2 and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-vpc.html)\. 

If a DB instance is in a VPC, the option group associated with the instance is linked to that VPC\. This means that you can't use the option group assigned to a DB instance if you try to restore the instance to a different VPC or a different platform\. If you restore a DB instance to a different VPC or a different platform, you can do one of the following: 
+ Assign the default option group to the DB instance\.
+ Assign an option group that is linked to that VPC or platform\.
+ Create a new option group and assign it to the DB instance\.

With persistent or permanent options, such as Oracle TDE, you must create a new option group that includes the persistent or permanent option when restoring a DB instance into a different VPC\.

Option settings control the behavior of an option\. For example, the Oracle Advanced Security option `NATIVE_NETWORK_ENCRYPTION` has a setting that you can use to specify the encryption algorithm for network traffic to and from the DB instance\. Some options settings are optimized for use with Amazon RDS and cannot be changed\.

### Mutually Exclusive Options<a name="Overview.OptionGroups.Exclusive"></a>

Some options are mutually exclusive\. You can use one or the other, but not both at the same time\. The following options are mutually exclusive: 
+ [Oracle Enterprise Manager Database Express](Appendix.Oracle.Options.OEM_DBControl.md) and [Oracle Management Agent for Enterprise Manager Cloud Control](Oracle.Options.OEMAgent.md)\. 
+ [Oracle Native Network Encryption](Appendix.Oracle.Options.NetworkEncryption.md) and [Oracle Secure Sockets Layer](Appendix.Oracle.Options.SSL.md)\. 

## Creating an Option Group<a name="USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.Create"></a>

You can create a new option group that derives its settings from the default option group, and then add one or more options to the new option group\. Alternatively, if you already have an existing option group, you can copy that option group with all of its options to a new option group\. For more information, see [Making a Copy of an Option Group](#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.Copy)\. 

After you create a new option group, it has no options\. To learn how to add options to the option group, see [Adding an Option to an Option Group](#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.AddOption)\. After you have added the options you want, you can then associate the option group with a DB instance so that the options become available on the DB instance\. For information about associating an option group with a DB instance, see the documentation for your specific engine listed at [Working with Option Groups](#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups)\. 

### Console<a name="USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.Create.Console"></a>

 One way of creating an option group is by using the AWS Management Console\. 

**To create a new option group by using the console**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Option groups**\.

1. Choose **Create group**\.

1. In the **Create option group** window, do the following:

   1. For **Name**, type a name for the option group that is unique within your AWS account\. The name can contain only letters, digits, and hyphens\. 

   1. For **Description**, type a brief description of the option group\. The description is used for display purposes\. 

   1. For **Engine**, choose the DB engine that you want\. 

   1. For **Major engine version**, choose the major version of the DB engine that you want\. 

1. To continue, choose **Create**\. To cancel the operation instead, choose **Cancel**\. 

### AWS CLI<a name="USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.Create.CLI"></a>

To create an option group, use the AWS CLI [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-option-group.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-option-group.html) command with the following required parameters\.
+ `--option-group-name`
+ `--engine-name`
+ `--major-engine-version`
+ `--option-group-description`

**Example**  
The following example creates an option group named `testoptiongroup`, which is associated with the Oracle Enterprise Edition DB engine\. The description is enclosed in quotation marks\.  
For Linux, OS X, or Unix:  

```
       
aws rds create-option-group \
    --option-group-name testoptiongroup \
    --engine-name oracle-ee \
    --major-engine-version 12.1 \
    --option-group-description "Test option group"
```
For Windows:  

```
aws rds create-option-group ^
    --option-group-name testoptiongroup ^
    --engine-name oracle-ee ^
    --major-engine-version 12.1 ^
    --option-group-description "Test option group"
```

### RDS API<a name="USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.Create.API"></a>

To create an option group, call the Amazon RDS API [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateOptionGroup.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateOptionGroup.html) operation\. Include the following parameters:
+ `OptionGroupName`
+ `EngineName`
+ `MajorEngineVersion`
+ `OptionGroupDescription`

## Making a Copy of an Option Group<a name="USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.Copy"></a>

You can use the AWS CLI or the Amazon RDS API to make a copy of an option group\. Copying an option group is convenient when you have an existing option group and you want to include most of its custom parameters and values in a new option group\. You can also make a copy of an option group that you use in production and then modify the copy to test other option settings\.

### AWS CLI<a name="USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.Copy.CLI"></a>

To copy an option group, use the AWS CLI [copy\-option\-group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/copy-option-group.html) command\. Include the following required parameters:
+ `--source-option-group-identifier`
+ `--target-option-group-identifier`
+ `--target-option-group-description`

**Example**  
The following example creates an option group named `new-local-option-group`, which is a local copy of the option group `my-remote-option-group`\.  
For Linux, OS X, or Unix:  

```
aws rds copy-option-group \
    --source-option-group-identifier arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:og:my-remote-option-group \
    --target-option-group-identifier new-local-option-group \
    --target-option-group-description "Option group 2"
```
For Windows:  

```
aws rds copy-option-group ^
    --source-option-group-identifier arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:og:my-remote-option-group ^
    --target-option-group-identifier new-local-option-group ^
    --target-option-group-description "Option group 2"
```

### RDS API<a name="USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.Copy.API"></a>

To copy an option group, call the Amazon RDS API [CopyOptionGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_CopyOptionGroup.html) operation\. Include the following required parameters\.
+ `SourceOptionGroupIdentifier`
+ `TargetOptionGroupIdentifier`
+ `TargetOptionGroupDescription`

## Adding an Option to an Option Group<a name="USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.AddOption"></a>

You can add an option to an existing option group\. After you have added the options you want, you can then associate the option group with a DB instance so that the options become available on the DB instance\. For information about associating an option group with a DB instance, see the documentation for your specific DB engine listed at [Working with Option Groups](#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups)\. 

Option group changes must be applied immediately in two cases: 
+ When you add an option that adds or updates a port value, such as the `OEM` option\. 
+ When you add or remove an option group with an option that includes a port value\. 

In these cases, choose the **Apply Immediately** option in the console\. Or you can include the `--apply-immediately` option when using the AWS CLI or set the `ApplyImmediately` parameter to `true` when using the Amazon RDS API\. Options that don't include port values can be applied immediately, or can be applied during the next maintenance window for the DB instance\. 

### Console<a name="USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.AddOption.Console"></a>

You can use the AWS Management Console to add an option to an option group\. 

**To add an option to an option group by using the console**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Option groups**\.

1. Select the option group that you want to modify, and then choose **Add 0ption**\.   
![\[Console option group\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/optiongroup-addoption1.png)

1. In the **Add option** window, do the following: 

   1. Choose the option that you want to add\. You might need to provide additional values, depending on the option that you select\. For example, when you choose the `OEM` option, you must also type a port value and specify a DB security group\.

   1. To enable the option on all associated DB instances as soon as you add it, for **Apply Immediately**, choose **Yes**\. If you choose **No** \(the default\), the option is enabled for each associated DB instance during its next maintenance window\.   
![\[Console option group\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/optiongroup-addoption2.png)

1. When the settings are as you want them, choose **Add Option**\. 

### AWS CLI<a name="USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.AddOptions.CLI"></a>

To add an option to an option group, run the AWS CLI [add\-option\-to\-option\-group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/add-option-to-option-group.html) command with the option that you want to add\. To enable the new option immediately on all associated DB instances, include the `--apply-immediately` parameter\. By default, the option is enabled for each associated DB instance during its next maintenance window\. Include the following required parameter:
+ `--option-group-name`

**Example**  
The following example adds the Oracle Enterprise Manager Database Control \(OEM\) option to an option group named `testoptiongroup` and immediately enables it\. Even if you use the default security group, you must specify that security group\.   
For Linux, OS X, or Unix:  

```
aws rds add-option-to-option-group \
 --option-group-name testoptiongroup \
 --options OptionName=OEM,Port=5500,DBSecurityGroupMemberships=default \
 --apply-immediately
```
For Windows:  

```
aws rds add-option-to-option-group ^
 --option-group-name testoptiongroup ^
 --options OptionName=OEM,Port=5500,DBSecurityGroupMemberships=default ^
 --apply-immediately
```
Command output is similar to the following:  

```
OPTIONGROUP   False  oracle-ee  12.1  arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:1234567890:og:testoptiongroup  Test Option Group  testoptiongroup default 
OPTIONS Oracle 12c EM Express   OEM     False   False   5500
DBSECURITYGROUPMEMBERSHIPS   default authorized
```

**Example**  
The following example adds the Oracle OEM option to an option group\. It also specifies a custom port and a pair of Amazon EC2 VPC security groups to use for that port\.  
For Linux, OS X, or Unix:  

```
aws rds add-option-to-option-group \
 --option-group-name testoptiongroup \
 --options OptionName=OEM,Port=5500,VpcSecurityGroupMemberships="sg-test1,sg-test2" \
 --apply-immediately
```
For Windows:  

```
aws rds add-option-to-option-group ^
 --option-group-name testoptiongroup ^
 --options OptionName=OEM,Port=5500,VpcSecurityGroupMemberships="sg-test1,sg-test2" ^
 --apply-immediately
```
Command output is similar to the following:  

```
OPTIONGROUP  False  oracle-ee  12.1 arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:1234567890:og:testoptiongroup   Test Option Group  testoptiongroup vpc-test 
OPTIONS Oracle 12c EM Express   OEM     False   False   5500
VPCSECURITYGROUPMEMBERSHIPS     active  sg-test1
VPCSECURITYGROUPMEMBERSHIPS     active  sg-test2
```

**Example**  
The following example adds the Oracle option NATIVE\_NETWORK\_ENCRYPTION to an option group and specifies the option settings\. If no option settings are specified, default values are used\.  
For Linux, OS X, or Unix:  

```
aws rds add-option-to-option-group \
  --option-group-name testoptiongroup \
  --options '[{"OptionSettings":[{"Name":"SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_SERVER","Value":"REQUIRED"},{"Name":"SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_SERVER","Value":"AES256,AES192,DES"}],"OptionName":"NATIVE_NETWORK_ENCRYPTION"}]' \
  --apply-immediately
```
For Windows:  

```
      
aws rds add-option-to-option-group ^
--option-group-name testoptiongroup ^
--options "OptionSettings"=[{"Name"="SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_SERVER","Value"="REQUIRED"},{"Name"="SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_SERVER","Value"="AES256\,AES192\,DES"}],"OptionName"="NATIVE_NETWORK_ENCRYPTION" ^
--apply-immediately
```
Command output is similar to the following:  

```
OPTIONGROUP  False  oracle-ee  12.1  arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:1234567890:og:testoptiongroup Test Option Group   testoptiongroup

### RDS API<a name="USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.ModifyOption.API"></a>

To modify an option setting, use the Amazon RDS API [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyOptionGroup.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyOptionGroup.html) command with the option group and option that you want to modify\. By default, the option is enabled for each associated DB instance during its next maintenance window\. To apply the change immediately to all associated DB instances, include the `ApplyImmediately` parameter and set it to `true`\.

## Removing an Option from an Option Group<a name="USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.RemoveOption"></a>

Some options can be removed from an option group, and some cannot\. A persistent option cannot be removed from an option group until all DB instances associated with that option group are disassociated\. A permanent option can never be removed from an option group\. For more information about what options are removable, see the documentation for your specific engine listed at [Working with Option Groups](#USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups)\. 

If you remove all options from an option group, Amazon RDS doesn't delete the option group\. DB instances that are associated with the empty option group continue to be associated with it; they just won’t have any active options\. Alternatively, to remove all options from a DB instance, you can associate the DB instance with the default \(empty\) option group\. 

### Console<a name="USER_WorkingWithOptionGroups.RemoveOption.Console"></a>

You can use the AWS Management Console to remove an option from an option group\.

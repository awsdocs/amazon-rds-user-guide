# Connecting to your Oracle DB instance<a name="USER_ConnectToOracleInstance"></a>

After Amazon RDS provisions your Oracle DB instance, you can use any standard SQL client application to connect to the DB instance\. In this topic, you connect to a DB instance that is running the Oracle database engine by using Oracle SQL Developer or SQL\*Plus\. 

For an example that walks you through the process of creating and connecting to a sample DB instance, see [Creating an Oracle DB instance and connecting to a database on an Oracle DB instance](CHAP_GettingStarted.CreatingConnecting.Oracle.md)\.

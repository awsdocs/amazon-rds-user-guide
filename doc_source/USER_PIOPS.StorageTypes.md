# Working with Storage for Amazon RDS DB Instances<a name="USER_PIOPS.StorageTypes"></a>

To specify how you want your data stored in Amazon RDS, choose a storage type and provide a storage size when you create or modify a DB instance\. Later, you can increase the amount or change the type of storage by modifying the DB instance\. For more information about which storage type to use for your workload, see [Amazon RDS Storage Types](CHAP_Storage.md#Concepts.Storage)\.

## Increasing DB Instance Storage Capacity<a name="USER_PIOPS.ModifyingExisting"></a>

If you need space for additional data, you can scale up the storage of an existing DB instance\. To do so, you can use the Amazon RDS Management Console, the Amazon RDS API, or the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\. For information about storage limits, see [Amazon RDS DB Instance Storage](CHAP_Storage.md)\.

**Note**  
Scaling storage for Amazon RDS for Microsoft SQL Server DB instances is supported only for General Purpose SSD or Provisioned IOPS SSD storage types\.

To monitor the amount of free storage for your DB instance so you can respond when necessary, we recommend that you create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm\. For more information on setting CloudWatch alarms, see [Using CloudWatch Alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html)\.

In most cases, scaling storage doesn't require any outage and doesn't degrade performance of the server\. After you modify the storage size for a DB instance, the status of the DB instance is **storage\-optimization**\. The DB instance is fully operational after a storage modification\.

**Note**  
You can't make further storage modifications until six \(6\) hours after storage optimization has completed on the instance\.

However, a special case is if you have a SQL Server DB instance and haven't modified the storage configuration since November 2017\. In this case, you might experience a short outage of a few minutes when you modify your DB instance to increase the allocated storage\. After the outage, the DB instance is online but in the `storage-optimization` state\. Performance might be degraded during storage optimization\. 

**Note**  
You can't reduce the amount of storage for a DB instance after storage has been allocated\.

### Console<a name="USER_PIOPS.ModifyingExisting.console"></a>

**To increase storage for a DB instance**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**\.

1. Choose the DB instance that you want to modify\.

1. Choose **Modify**\.

1. Enter a new value for **Allocated Storage**\. It must be greater than the current value\.   
![\[Modify the amount of storage for a DB instance\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/images/scale-gs2.png)
**Note**  
When you increase **Allocated Storage**, it must be by at least 10 percent\. If you try to increase the value by less than 10 percent, you see an error\.

1. Choose **Continue** to move to the next screen\.

1. Choose **Apply immediately** in the **Scheduling of modifications** section to apply the storage changes to the DB instance immediately\. Or choose **Apply during the next scheduled maintenance window** to apply the changes during the next maintenance window\.

1. When the settings are as you want them, choose **Modify DB instance**\.

### AWS CLI<a name="USER_PIOPS.ModifyingExisting.cli"></a>

To increase the storage for a DB instance, use the AWS CLI command [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.html)\. Set the following parameters:
+ `--allocated-storage` – Amount of storage to be allocated for the DB instance, in gibibytes\.
+ `--apply-immediately` – Use `--apply-immediately` to change to the new storage type immediately\. Or use `--no-apply-immediately` \(the default\) to apply storage changes during the next maintenance window\. An immediate outage occurs when the changes are applied\.

For more information about storage, see [Amazon RDS DB Instance Storage](CHAP_Storage.md)\.

### Amazon RDS API<a name="USER_PIOPS.ModifyingExisting.api"></a>

To increase storage for a DB instance, use the Amazon RDS API operation [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyDBInstance.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyDBInstance.html)\. Set the following parameters:
+ `AllocatedStorage` – Amount of storage to be allocated for the DB instance, in gibibytes\.
+ `ApplyImmediately` – Set this option to `True` to apply scaling changes immediately\. Set this option to `False` \(the default\) to apply scaling changes during the next maintenance window\. An immediate outage occurs when the changes are applied\.

For more information about storage, see [Amazon RDS DB Instance Storage](CHAP_Storage.md)\.

## Managing Capacity Automatically with Amazon RDS Storage Autoscaling<a name="USER_PIOPS.Autoscaling"></a>

If your workload is unpredictable, you can enable storage autoscaling for an Amazon RDS DB instance\. To do so, you can use the Amazon RDS console, the Amazon RDS API, or the AWS CLI\. 

For example, you might use this feature for a new mobile gaming application that users are adopting rapidly\. In this case, a rapidly increasing workload might exceed the available database storage\. To avoid having to manually scale up database storage, you can use Amazon RDS storage autoscaling\. 

With storage autoscaling enabled, when Amazon RDS detects that you are running out of free database space it automatically scales up your storage\. Amazon RDS starts a storage modification for an autoscaling\-enabled DB instance when these factors apply:
+ Free available space is less than 10 percent of the allocated storage\.
+ The low\-storage condition lasts at least five minutes\.
+ At least six hours have passed since the last storage modification\.

The additional storage is in increments of whichever is greater, 5 GiB or 12% of currently allocated storage\. The maximum storage threshold is the limit to which the DB instance can be autoscaled\. You can't set the maximum storage threshold for autoscaling\-enabled instances to a value greater than the maximum allocated storage\.

For example, SQL Server Standard Edition on db\.m5\.xlarge has a default allocated storage for the instance of 20 GiB \(the minimum\) and a maximum allocated storage of 16,384 GiB\. The default maximum storage threshold for autoscaling is 1,000 GiB\. If you use this default, the instance doesn't autoscale above 1,000 GiB\. This is true even though the maximum allocated storage for the instance is 16,384 GiB\.

**Note**  
Autoscaling doesn't occur if the maximum storage threshold would be exceeded by the storage increment\.  
Autoscaling can't completely prevent storage\-full situations for large data loads, because further storage modifications can't be made until six hours after storage optimization has completed on the instance\. If you perform a large data load, and autoscaling doesn't provide enough space, the database might remain in the storage\-full state for several hours\. This can harm the database\.  
If you start a storage scaling operation at the same time that Amazon RDS starts an autoscaling operation, your storage modification takes precedence\. The autoscaling operation is canceled\.

Although automatic scaling helps you to increase storage on your Amazon RDS DB instance dynamically, you should still configure the initial storage for your DB instance to an appropriate size for your typical workload\.

### Enabling Storage Autoscaling for a New DB Instance<a name="USER_PIOPS.EnablingAutoscaling"></a>

When you create a new Amazon RDS DB instance, you can choose whether to enable storage autoscaling\. You can also set an upper limit on the storage that Amazon RDS can allocate for the DB instance\. 

**Note**  
When you clone an Amazon RDS DB instance that has storage autoscaling enabled, that setting isn't automatically inherited by the cloned instance\. The new DB instance has the same amount of allocated storage as the original instance\. You can turn storage autoscaling on again for the new instance if the cloned instance continues to increase its storage requirements\.

#### Console<a name="USER_PIOPS.EnablingAutoscaling.console"></a>

## Modifying SSD Storage Settings for Provisioned IOPS<a name="User_PIOPS.Increase"></a>

You can modify the settings for a DB instance that uses Provisioned IOPS SSD storage by using the Amazon RDS console, AWS CLI, or Amazon RDS API\. Specify the storage type, allocated storage, and the amount of Provisioned IOPS that you require\. You can choose from a range between 1,000 IOPS and 100 GiB of storage up to 80,000 IOPS and 64 TiB \(64,000 GiB\) of storage\. The range depends on your database engine and instance type\. 

Although you can reduce the amount of IOPS provisioned for your instance, you can't reduce the amount of General Purpose SSD or magnetic storage allocated\. 

In most cases, scaling storage doesn't require any outage and doesn't degrade performance of the server\. After you modify the storage size for a DB instance, the status of the DB instance is **storage\-optimization**\. The DB instance is fully operational after a storage modification\.

**Note**  
You can't make further storage modifications until six \(6\) hours after storage optimization has completed on the instance\.

### Console<a name="User_PIOPS.Increase.con"></a>

**To change the Provisioned IOPS settings for a DB instance**

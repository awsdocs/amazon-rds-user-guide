# Managing Connections with Amazon RDS Proxy \(Preview\)<a name="rds-proxy"></a>


|  | 
| --- |
| This is preview documentation for Amazon RDS Proxy\. It is subject to change\. | 

 Amazon RDS Proxy allows applications to pool and share database connections to improve scalability\. It makes applications more resilient to database failures by automatically connecting to a standby DB instance while preserving application connections\. RDS Proxy also allows you to enforce AWS IAM \(Identity and Access Management\) authentication to databases, and securely store credentials in Secrets Manager\. RDS Proxy is fully compatible with MySQL and can be enabled for most applications with no code change\. 

 You can handle unpredictable surges in database traffic, which otherwise could cause issues due to oversubscribing connections or creating new connections at a fast rate\. RDS Proxy establishes a database connection pool and reuses connections in this pool without the memory and CPU overhead of opening a new database connection each time\. To protect the database against oversubscription, you can control the number of database connections that are created\. RDS Proxy sequences or throttles application connections that can't be served immediately from the pool of connections\. Although latencies might increase, your application can continue to scale without abruptly failing or overwhelming the database\. If connection requests exceed the limits you specify, RDS Proxy rejects application connections \(sheds load\) while maintaining predictable performance for the load that can be served with available capacity\. 

 You can reduce the overhead to process credentials and establish a secure connection for each new connection\. RDS Proxy can handle some of that work on behalf of the database\. 

**Important**  
 Currently, Amazon RDS Proxy is in preview\. Don't use RDS Proxy for production workloads\. Also, we strongly recommend not putting sensitive data in databases that you use with RDS Proxy preview\. You might encounter issues during the preview that cause incorrect results, corrupted data, or both\. Over the duration of the preview, we might introduce breaking changes without advance notice\. These might include upgrades and changes to our APIs\.

## RDS Proxy Concepts and Terminology<a name="rds-proxy.howitworks"></a>

 You can simplify connection management for your Amazon RDS DB instances and Aurora DB clusters by using RDS Proxy\. 

 RDS Proxy handles the network traffic between the client application and the database\. It does so in an active way by understanding the database protocol and adjusting its behavior based on the SQL operations from your application and the result sets from the database\. RDS Proxy reduces the memory and CPU overhead for connection management on your database\. The database needs less memory and CPU resources when applications open many simultaneous connections\. It also doesn't require logic in your applications to close and reopen connections that stay idle for a long time\. Similarly, it requires less application logic to reestablish connections in case of a database problem\. 

 The infrastructure for RDS Proxy is independent of the database servers for the RDS DB instances and Aurora DB clusters\. This separation helps lower overhead on your database servers, so that they can devote their resources to serving database workloads\.

### Overview of RDS Proxy Terminology<a name="rds-proxy-overview"></a>

 RDS Proxy handles the infrastructure to perform connection pooling and the other features described in this documentation\. You see the proxies represented in the AWS Management Console for RDS on the **Proxies** page\. 

 Each proxy handles connections to a single RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster\. For RDS multi\-AZ DB instances and Aurora provisioned clusters, the proxy determines the current writer instance\.  

 The connections that a proxy keeps open and available for your database application to use form the *connection pool*\. 

 By default, RDS Proxy can reuse a connection after each transaction in your session\. This transaction\-level reuse is called *multiplexing*\. When the RDS Proxy can't be sure that it's safe to run different transactions from a session using different connections, it keeps the session on the same connection until the session ends\. This fallback behavior is called *pinning*\. 

 A proxy has an endpoint\. You connect to this endpoint when you work with an RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster, instead of the read\-write endpoint that connects directly to the instance or cluster\. The special\-purpose endpoints for an Aurora cluster remain available for you to use\. For example, you can still connect to the cluster endpoint for read\-write connections without connection pooling\. You can still connect to the reader endpoint for load\-balanced read\-only connections\. You can still connect to the instance endpoints for diagnosis and troubleshooting of specific DB instances within an Aurora cluster\. If you are using other AWS services such as AWS Lambda to connect to RDS databases, you change their connection settings to use the proxy endpoint\. For example, you specify the proxy endpoint to allow Lambda functions to access your database while taking advantage of RDS Proxy functionality\. 

 Each proxy contains a target group\. This *target group* embodies the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster that the proxy can connect to\. For an Aurora cluster, by default the target group is associated with all the DB instances in that cluster\. That way, the proxy can connect to whichever Aurora DB instance is promoted to be the writer instance in the cluster\. The RDS DB instance associated with a proxy, or the Aurora DB cluster and its instances, are referred to as the *targets* of that proxy\. For convenience, when you create a proxy through the AWS Management Console, RDS Proxy also creates the corresponding target group and registers the associated targets automatically\. 

 An *engine family* is a related set of database engines that use the same DB protocol\. You choose the engine family for each proxy that you create\. During the preview, RDS Proxy supports one engine family, consisting of RDS MySQL 5\.6 and 5\.7, and Aurora MySQL\. Within the MySQL engine family, currently RDS Proxy supports Aurora provisioned clusters, Aurora parallel query clusters, and Aurora Global Databases\. For a global database, you can create a proxy for the primary AWS Region, but not for the read\-only secondary AWS Regions\. RDS Proxy currently doesn't support Aurora Serverless clusters and Aurora multi\-master clusters\. 

### Connection Pooling<a name="rds-proxy-connection-pooling"></a>

 Each proxy performs connection pooling for the writer instance of its associated RDS or Aurora database\. *Connection pooling* is an optimization that reduces the overhead associated with opening and closing connections, and keeping many connections open simultaneously\. This overhead includes memory needed to handle each new connection\. It also involves CPU overhead to close each connection and open a new one, such as TLS handshaking, authentication, negotiating capabilities, and so on\. Connection pooling simplifies your application logic\. You don't need to write application code to minimize the number of simultaneous open connections\. 

 Each proxy also performs connection multiplexing, also known as connection reuse\. With *multiplexing*, RDS Proxy perform all the operations for a transaction using one underlying database connection, then can use a different connection for the next transaction\. You can open many simultaneous connections to the proxy, and the proxy keeps a smaller number of connections open to the DB instance or cluster\. Doing so further minimizes the memory overhead for connections on the database server\. This technique also reduces the chance of "too many connections" errors\. 

### RDS Proxy Security<a name="rds-proxy-security"></a>

 RDS Proxy uses the existing RDS security mechanisms such as Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) and AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)\. For general information about those security features, see [Security in Amazon RDS](UsingWithRDS.md)\. If you aren't familiar with how RDS and Aurora work with authentication, authorization, and other areas of security, consult those resources first\. 

 RDS Proxy can act as an additional layer of security between client applications and the underlying database\. For example, you can connect to the proxy using TLS 1\.2, even if the underlying DB instance only supports TLS 1\.0 or 1\.1\. You can connect to the proxy using an IAM role, even if the proxy connects to the database using the native user/password authentication method\. By using this technique, you can enforce strong authentication requirements for database applications without a costly migration effort for the DB instances themselves\. 

 You store the database credentials used by RDS Proxy in AWS Secrets Manager\. Each database user for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster accessed by a proxy must have a corresponding secret in Secrets Manager\. You can also set up IAM authentication for users of RDS Proxy\. By doing so, you can enforce IAM authentication for database access even if the databases still use native password authentication\. These security features are a preferable alternative to embedding database credentials in your application code\. 

### Failover<a name="rds-proxy-failover"></a>

 Failover is a high\-availability feature that replaces a database instance with another one when the original instance becomes unavailable\. A failover might happen because of a problem with a database instance\. It could also be part of normal maintenance procedures, such as while performing a database upgrade\. Failover applies to RDS DB instances in a multi\-AZ configuration, and Aurora DB clusters with one or more reader instances in addition to the writer instance\. 

 Without RDS Proxy, a failover involves a brief outage\. During the outage, you can't perform write operations on that database\. Any existing database connections are disrupted and your application must reopen them\. The database becomes available for new connections and write operations when a read\-only DB instance is promoted to take the place of the one that's unavailable\. 

 Connecting through a proxy makes your application more resilient to database failovers\. When the original DB instance becomes unavailable, RDS Proxy connects to the standby database without dropping idle application connections\. Doing so helps to speed up and simplify the failover process\. The result is faster failover that's less disruptive to your application than a typical reboot or database problem\. 

 During DB failovers, RDS Proxy continues to accept connections at the same IP address and automatically directs connections to the new master\. Clients connecting through RDS Proxy are not susceptible to DNS propagation delays on failover, local DNS caching, connection timeouts, uncertainty about which DB instance is the current writer, or waiting for a query response from a former writer that became unavailable without closing connections\. 

 For applications that maintain their own connection pool, going through RDS Proxy means that most connections stay alive during failovers or other disruptions\. Only connections that are in the middle of a transaction or SQL statement are cancelled\. RDS Proxy immediately accepts new connections\. When the database writer is unavailable, RDS Proxy queues up incoming requests\. 

 For applications that don't maintain their own connection pools, RDS Proxy offers faster connection rates and more open connections\. It offloads the expensive overhead of frequent reconnects from the database\. It does so by reusing database connections maintained in the RDS Proxy connection pool\. This is particularly important for TLS connections, where setup costs are significant\. 

### Transactions<a name="rds-proxy-transactions"></a>

 All the statements within a single transaction always use the same underlying database connection\. The connection becomes available for use by a different session when the transaction ends\. Using the transaction as the unit of granularity has the following consequences: 
+  Connection reuse can happen after each individual statement when the `autocommit` setting is enabled\. 
+  Conversely, when the `autocommit` setting is disabled, the first statement you issue in a session begins a new transaction\. Thus, if you enter a sequence of `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and other data manipulation language \(DML\) statements, connection reuse doesn't happen until you issue a `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, or otherwise end the transaction\. 
+  Entering a data definition language \(DDL\) statement causes the transaction to end after that statement completes\. 

 RDS Proxy detects when a transaction ends through the network protocol used by the database client application\. Transaction detection doesn't rely on keywords such as `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` appearing in the text of the SQL statement\. 

 If RDS Proxy detects a database request that makes it impractical to move your session to a different connection, it turns off multiplexing for that connection the remainder of your session\. The same rule applies if RDS Proxy can't be certain that multiplexing is practical for the session\. This operation is called pinning\. For ways to detect and minimize pinning, see [Pinning](#rds-proxy-pinning)\.

| This is preview documentation for Amazon RDS Proxy\. It is subject to change\. | 

 In the following sections, you can find how to set up RDS Proxy\. You can also find how to set the related security options that control who can access each proxy and how each proxy connects to DB instances\.

### Identifying DB Instances, Clusters, and Applications to Use with RDS Proxy<a name="rds-proxy-planning"></a>

 You can determine which of your DB instances, clusters, and applications might benefit the most from using RDS Proxy\. To do so, consider these factors: 
+  Any DB instance or cluster that ever encounters "too many connections" errors is a good candidate for associating with a proxy\. The proxy enables applications to open many client connections, while the proxy manages a smaller number of long\-lived connections to the DB instance or cluster\. 
+  For DB instances or clusters that use smaller AWS instance classes, such as T2 or T3, using a proxy can help avoid out\-of\-memory conditions and reduce the CPU overhead for establishing connections\. These conditions can occur when dealing with large numbers of connections\. 
+  You can monitor certain Amazon CloudWatch metrics to determine whether a DB instance or cluster is approaching its limits for number of connections or the memory associated with connection management\. You can also monitor certain CloudWatch metrics to determine whether a DB instance or cluster is handling many short\-lived connections\. Opening and closing such connections can impose performance overhead on your database\. For information about the metrics to monitor, see [Monitoring RDS ProxyMonitoring](#rds-proxy.monitoring)\. 
+  AWS Lambda functions can also be good candidates for using with a proxy\. These functions make frequent short database connections that benefit from connection pooling offered by RDS Proxy\. You can take advantage of any IAM authentication you already have for Lambda functions, instead of managing database credentials in your Lambda application code\. 
+  Applications that use languages and frameworks such as PHP and Ruby on Rails are typically good candidates for using with a proxy\. Such applications typically open and close large numbers of database connections, and don't have built\-in connection pooling mechanisms\. 
+  Applications that keep a large number of connections open for long periods are typically good candidates for using with a proxy\. Applications in industries such as software as a service \(SaaS\) or ecommerce often minimize the latency for database requests by leaving connections open\. 
+  You might not have adopted IAM authentication and Secrets Manager due to the complexity of setting up such authentication for all DB instances and clusters\. If so, you can leave the existing authentication methods in place and delegate the authentication to a proxy\. The proxy can enforce the authentication policies for client connections for particular applications\. You can take advantage of any IAM authentication you already have for Lambda functions, instead of managing database credentials in your Lambda application code\. 

### Setting Up Network Prerequisites<a name="rds-proxy-network-prereqs"></a>

 Using RDS Proxy requires you to have a set of networking resources in place, such as a virtual private cloud \(VPC\), two or more subnets, EC2 instance within the same VPC, and Internet gateway\. If you've successfully connected to any RDS DB instances or Aurora DB clusters, you already have the required network resources\. 

### Setting Up Database Credentials in AWS Secrets Manager<a name="rds-proxy-secrets-arns"></a>

 For each proxy that you create, you first use the Secrets Manager service to store sets of user name and password credentials\. You create a separate Secrets Manager secret for each database user account that the proxy connects to on the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster\. 

 In Secrets Manager, you create these secrets with the `username` and `password` fields\. Doing so allows the proxy to connect to the corresponding database users on whichever RDS DB instances or Aurora DB clusters that you associate with the proxy\. To do this, you can use the setting **Credentials for other database**, **Credentials for RDS database**, or **Other type of secrets**\. 

 The proxy ignores other fields such as `host` and `port` if they're present in the secret\. Those details are automatically supplied by the proxy\. If you choose **Credentials for other database**, that option prompts you for the user name and password, but not the other connection details, which you specify in the settings for the proxy itself\. If you choose **Other type of secrets**, you create the secret with keys named `username` and `password`\. 

 Don't choose any rotation period for the secrets\. 

 Because the secrets aren't tied to a specific database server, you can reuse a secret across multiple proxies if you use the same credentials across multiple database servers\. For example, you might use the same credentials across a group of development and test servers\. 

 If a password associated with a secret is incorrect, you can update the associated secret in Secrets Manager\. For example, you might update the secret if the password for the database account changes\. Until you update the secret, you can't connect through the proxy to that database account\. You can still connect to other accounts where the passwords match the credentials stored in the secrets\. 

 When you create a proxy through the AWS CLI or RDS API, you specify the Amazon Resource Names \(ARNs\) of the corresponding secrets for all the DB user accounts that the proxy can access\. In the AWS Management Console, you choose the secrets by their descriptive names\. 

 For instructions about creating secrets in Secrets Manager, see the [Creating a Secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_create-basic-secret.html) page in the Secrets Manager documentation\. Use one of the following techniques\. For instructions about creating secrets in Secrets Manager, see [Creating a Secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_create-basic-secret.html) in the *AWS Secrets Manager User Guide*\. Use one of the following techniques: 
+  Use [Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) in the console\. 
+  To use the CLI to create a Secrets Manager secret for use with RDS Proxy, use a command such as the following\. 

  ```
  aws secretsmanager create-secret
    --name "secret_name"
    --description "secret_description"
    --region region_name
    --secret-string "{\"username\":\"db_user\",\"password\":\"db_user_password\"}"
  ```

 For example, the following commands create Secrets Manager secrets for two database users, one named `admin` and the other named `app-user` 

```
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name $ADMIN_SECRET --description 'db admin user' \
  --secret-string '{"username":"admin","password":"choose_your_own_password"}'

aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name $PROXY_SECRET --description 'application user' \
  --secret-string '{"username":"app-user","password":"choose_your_own_password"}'
```

### Setting Up AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) Policies<a name="rds-proxy-iam-setup"></a>

 After you create the secrets in Secrets Manager, you create an IAM policy that can access those secrets\. 
+  Follow the **Create Role** process\. Include the **Add Role to Database** step\. 
+  For the new role, perform the **Add inline policy** step\. Paste the following JSON, substituting the ARN for the secret that you created\. 

  ```
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "secretsmanager:GetRandomPassword",
                  "secretsmanager:CreateSecret",
                  "secretsmanager:ListSecrets"
              ],
              "Resource": "*"
          },
          {
              "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": "secretsmanager:*",
              "Resource": [
                       "your_secret_ARN"
              ]
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
+  Optionally, edit the trust policy for this IAM policy\. Paste the following JSON\. 

  ```
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "Service": "rds.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
      },
      {
        "Sid": "",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "Service": "rds.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

 The following commands perform the same operation through the AWS CLI\. 

```
PREFIX=choose_an_identifier

aws iam create-role --role-name choose_role_name \
  --assume-role-policy-document "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"Service\":[\"rds.amazonaws.com\"]},\"Action\":\"sts:AssumeRole\"}]}"
aws iam put-role-policy --role-name same_role_name_as_previous \
  --policy-name $PREFIX-secret-reader-policy --policy-document '{"Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":[{"Sid":"getsecretvalue","Effect":"Allow","Action":["secretsmanager:GetSecretValue","kms:Decrypt"],"Resource":"*"}]}'

aws kms create-key --description "$PREFIX-test-key" --policy "{\"Id\":\"$PREFIX-kms-policy\",\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"Enable IAM User Permissions\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"AWS\":\"arn:aws:iam::account_id:root\"},\"Action\":\"kms:*\",\"Resource\":\"*\"},{\"Sid\":\"Allow access for Key Administrators\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"AWS\":[\"$USER_ARN\",\"arn:aws:iam::account_id:role/Admin\"]},\"Action\":[\"kms:Create*\",\"kms:Describe*\",\"kms:Enable*\",\"kms:List*\",\"kms:Put*\",\"kms:Update*\",\"kms:Revoke*\",\"kms:Disable*\",\"kms:Get*\",\"kms:Delete*\",\"kms:TagResource\",\"kms:UntagResource\",\"kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion\",\"kms:CancelKeyDeletion\"],\"Resource\":\"*\"},{\"Sid\":\"Allow use of the key\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"AWS\":\"$ROLE_ARN\"},\"Action\":[\"kms:Decrypt\",\"kms:DescribeKey\"],\"Resource\":\"*\"}]}"
```

### Creating an RDS Proxy<a name="rds-proxy-creating"></a>

 To manage connections for a specified set of DB instances, you can create a proxy\. You can associate a proxy with an RDS MySQL DB instance or a Aurora MySQL DB cluster\. 

#### AWS Management Console<a name="rds-proxy-creating.console"></a>

**To create a proxy**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1.  In the navigation pane, choose **Proxies**\. 

1.  Choose **Create proxy**\. 

1.  Choose all the settings for your proxy\. For the public preview, some choices are restricted or required\. Consider the following guidance: 

    **Proxy configuration**: 
   +  **Proxy identifier**\. Specify a name of your choosing, unique within your AWS account ID and current AWS Region\. 
   +  **Engine compatibility**\. Currently, **MySQL** is the only choice\. 
   +  **Require Transport Layer Security**\. Choose this setting if you want the proxy to enforce TLS / SSL for all client connections\. When you use an encrypted or unencrypted connection to a proxy, the proxy uses the same encryption setting when it makes a connection to the underlying database\. 
   +  **Idle client connection timeout**\. Choose a time period that a client connection can be idle before the proxy can close it\. A client connection is considered idle when the application doesn't submit a new request within the specified time after the previous request completed\. The underlying database connection stays open and is returned to the connection pool\. Thus, it's available to be reused for new client connections\. 

    **Target group configuration**: 
   +  **Database**\. Choose one RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster to access through this proxy\. The list only includes DB instances and clusters with compatible database engines, engine versions, and other settings\. If the list is empty, create a new DB instance or cluster that's compatible with RDS Proxy\. Then try creating the proxy again\. 
   +  **Connection pool maximum connections**\. Specify a value between 1 and 100\. This setting represents the percentage of the `max_connections` value that RDS Proxy can use for its connections\. If you only intend to use one proxy with this DB instance or cluster, you can set it to 100\. For details about how RDS Proxy uses this setting, see [Connection Limits and Timeouts](#rds-proxy-connection-limits)\. 
   +  **Session pinning filters**\. This is an advanced setting, for troubleshooting performance issues with particular applications\. Currently, the only choice is `EXCLUDE_VARIABLE_SETS`\. Only choose a filter if your application isn't reusing connections due to certain kinds of SQL statements, and if you can verify that reusing connections with those SQL statements doesn't affect application correctness\. 
   +  **Connection borrow timeout**\. If you expect the proxy to sometimes use up all available connections, you can specify how long the proxy waits for a connection to become available before returning a timeout error\. This setting only applies when the proxy has the maximum number of connections open and all connections are already in use\. 

    **Connectivity**: 
   +  **Secrets Manager ARNs**\. Choose at least one Secrets Manager secret associated with the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster that you intend to access with this proxy\. 
   +  **IAM role**\. Choose an IAM role that has permission to access the Secrets Manager secrets you chose earlier\. You can also choose for the AWS Management Console to create a new IAM role for you and use that\. 
   +  **IAM Authentication**\. Choose whether to require or disallow IAM authentication for connections to your proxy\. 
   +  **Subnets**\. This field is prepopulated with all the subnets associated with your VPC\. Remove any subnets that you don't need for this proxy\. You must leave at least two subnets\. 

    **Additional connectivity configuration**: 
   +  **VPC security group**\. Choose an existing VPC security group\. You can also choose for the AWS Management Console to create a new security group for you and use that\. 

    **Advanced configuration**: 
   +  **Enable enhanced logging**\. You can enable this setting to troubleshoot proxy compatibility or performance issues\. When this setting is enabled, RDS Proxy includes detailed information about SQL statements in its logs\. This information helps you to debug issues involving SQL behavior or the performance and scalability of the proxy connections\. The debug information includes the text of SQL statements that you submit through the proxy\. Thus, only enable this setting when needed for debugging, and only when you have security measures in place to safeguard any sensitive information that appears in the logs\. 

1.  Select **RDS Proxy is now available in internal Preview** to acknowledge the terms and conditions for the preview\. 

1.  Choose **Create Proxy**\. 

#### AWS CLI<a name="rds-proxy-creating.CLI"></a>

 To create a DB instance, use the AWS CLI command [ `create-db-proxy`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-proxy.html)\. 

**Example**  
For Linux, OS X, or Unix:  

```
aws rds create-db-proxy \
    --db-proxy-name proxy_name \
    --role-arn iam_role \
    --engine-family { MYSQL } \
    --vpc-subnet-ids space_separated_list \
    [--vpc-security-group-ids space_separated_list] \
    [--auth ProxyAuthenticationConfig_JSON_string] \
    [--require-tls | --no-require-tls] \
    [--idle-client-timeout value] \
    [--debug-logging | --no-debug-logging] \
    [--tags comma_separated_list]
```
For Windows:  

```
aws rds create-db-proxy ^
    --db-proxy-name proxy_name ^
    --role-arn iam_role ^
    --engine-family { MYSQL } ^
    --vpc-subnet-ids space_separated_list ^
    [--vpc-security-group-ids space_separated_list] ^
    [--auth ProxyAuthenticationConfig_JSON_string] ^
    [--require-tls | --no-require-tls] ^
    [--idle-client-timeout value] ^
    [--debug-logging | --no-debug-logging] ^
    [--tags comma_separated_list]
```

 To create the required information and associations for the proxy, you also use these commands: 

```
aws rds create-db-proxy-target-group
    --name target_group_name
    --db-proxy-name proxy_name
    --connection-pool-defaults ConnectionPoolConfiguration
    --tags comma_separated_list
```

```
aws rds register-db-proxy-targets
    --db-proxy-name value
    [--target-group-name target_group_name]
    [--db-instance-identifiers space_separated_list]  # rds db instances, or
    [--db-cluster-identifiers cluster_id]        # rds db cluster (all instances), or
    [--db-cluster-endpoint endpoint_name]          # rds db cluster endpoint (all instances)
```

#### RDS API<a name="rds-proxy-creating.API"></a>

 To create an RDS Proxy, you call the Amazon RDS API function [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDBProxy.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDBProxy.html)\. You pass a parameter with the [AuthConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_AuthConfig.html) data structure\. 

 You also create the associated target group by calling the function [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDBProxyTargetGroup.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDBProxyTargetGroup.html)\. Then you associate an RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster with the target group by calling the function [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterDBProxyTargets.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterDBProxyTargets.html)\. 

### Viewing RDS Proxy<a name="rds-proxy-viewing"></a>

 After you create one or more RDS proxies, you can view them all to examine their configuration details and choose which ones to modify, delete, and so on\. 

 In particular, you need the endpoint for the proxy to use in the connection string for any database applications that use the proxy\. 

#### AWS Management Console<a name="rds-proxy-viewing.console"></a>

**To view your RDS Proxy**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1.  In the upper\-right corner of the AWS Management Console, choose the AWS Region in which you created the RDS Proxy\. 

1.  In the navigation pane, choose **Proxies**\. 

1.  Choose the name of an RDS proxy to display its details\. 

1.  On the details page, the **Target groups** section shows how the proxy is associated with a specific RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster\. You can follow the link to the **default** target group page to see more details about the association between the proxy and the database\. This page is where you see settings that you specified when creating the proxy, such as maximum connection percentage, connection borrow timeout, engine compatibility, and session pinning filters\. 

#### CLI<a name="rds-proxy-viewing.cli"></a>

 To view your RDS Proxy using the CLI, use the `describe-db-proxies` command\. By default, it displays all proxies owned by your AWS account\. You can specify `--db-proxy-name` parameter to see details for a single proxy\. 

```
aws rds describe-db-proxies
    [--db-proxy-name proxy_name]
```

 To view the other information associated with the proxy, use these commands: 

```
aws rds describe-db-proxy-target-groups \
    --db-proxy-name proxy_name

aws rds describe-db-proxy-targets \
    --db-proxy-name proxy_name
```

 Use the following sequence of commands to see more detail about the things that are associated with the proxy: 
+  Run `describe-db-proxies` to get a list of proxies\. 
+  Run `describe-db-proxy-target-groups -—db-proxy-name` using the name of the proxy as the parameter\. This output shows connection parameters such as the maximum percentage of connections that the proxy can use\. 
+  Run `describe-db-proxy-targets` to see the details of the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster associated with the returned target group\. 

#### RDS API<a name="rds-proxy-viewing.api"></a>

 To view your proxies using the RDS API, use the [DescribeDBProxies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBProxies.html) operation\. It returns values of the [DBProxy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DBProxy.html) data type\. 

 You can use the proxy identifiers from the return value to see details of the connection settings for the proxy by using the [DescribeDBProxyTargetGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBProxyTargetGroups.html) operation\. It returns values of the [DBProxyTargetGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DBProxyTargetGroup.html) data type\. 

 You can see the RDS instance or Aurora DB cluster associated with the proxy by using the [DescribeDBProxyTargets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBProxyTargets.html) operation\. It returns values of the [DBProxyTarget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DBProxyTarget.html) data type\. 

### Deleting an RDS Proxy<a name="rds-proxy-deleting"></a>

 You can delete a proxy if you no longer need it\. You might delete a proxy because the application that was using it is no longer relevant\. Or you might delete a proxy if you take the DB instance or cluster associated with it out of service\. 

#### AWS Management Console<a name="rds-proxy-deleting.console"></a>

**To delete a proxy**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1.  In the navigation pane, choose **Proxies**\. 

1.  Choose the proxy to delete from the list\. 

1.  Choose **Delete Proxy**\. 

#### AWS CLI<a name="rds-proxy-deleting.CLI"></a>

 To delete a DB proxy, use the AWS CLI command [ `delete-db-proxy`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/delete-db-proxy.html)\. 

**Example**  

```
aws rds delete-db-proxy --name proxy_name
```

```
aws rds deregister-db-proxy-targets
    --db-proxy-name proxy_name
    [--target-group-name target_group_name]
    [--target-ids comma_separated_list]       # or
    [--db-instance-identifiers instance_id]       # or
    [--db-cluster-identifiers cluster_id]
```

#### RDS API<a name="rds-proxy-deleting.API"></a>

 To delete a DB proxy, call the Amazon RDS API function [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteDBProxy.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteDBProxy.html)\. To delete related items and associations, you also call the functions [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteDBProxyTargetGroup.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteDBProxyTargetGroup.html) and [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DeregisterDBProxyTargets.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DeregisterDBProxyTargets.html)\. 

### Modifying an RDS Proxy<a name="rds-proxy-modifying-proxy"></a>

 You can change certain settings associated with a proxy after you create the proxy\. You do so by modifying the proxy itself, its associated target group, or both\. Each proxy has an associated target group\. 

#### AWS Management Console<a name="rds-proxy-modifying-proxy.console"></a>

**To modify the settings for a proxy**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1.  In the navigation pane, choose **Proxies**\. 

1.  In the list of proxies, choose the proxy whose settings you want to modify or go to its details page\. 

1.  For **Actions**, choose **Modify**\. 

1.  Enter or choose the properties to modify\. 
   +  You can rename the proxy by entering a new identifier\. 
   +  You can turn the requirement for Transport layer Security \(TLS\) on or off\. 
   +  You can enter a time period for the idle connection timeout\. 
   +  You can add or remove Secrets Manager secrets\. These secrets correspond to database user names and passwords\. 
   +  You can change the IAM role used to retrieve the secrets from Secrets Manager\. 
   +  You can require or disallow IAM authentication for connections to the proxy\. 
   +  You can add or remove VPC subnets for the proxy to use\. 
   +  You can add or remove VPC security groups for the proxy to use\. 
   +  You can enable or disable enhanced logging\. 

1.  Choose **Modify**\. 

 If you didn't find the settings you intended to change, continue with the following procedure to update the target group for the proxy\. Each proxy has one associated target group, which is created automatically along with the proxy\. 

**To modify the settings for a proxy target group**

 The target group associated with a proxy controls the settings related to the physical database connections\. You can only modify the target group from the proxy details page, not from the list on the **Proxies** page\. 

1.  From the **Proxies** page, go to the details page for a proxy\. 

1.  For **Target groups**, choose the `default` link\. Currently, all proxies have a single target group named `default`\. 

1.  On the details page for the **default** target group, choose **Modify**\. 

1.  Certain properties, such as the target group identifier and the database engine, are fixed\. You can't change these properties\. 

    Choose new settings for the properties you can modify: 
   +  You can choose a different RDS DB instance or Aurora cluster\. 
   +  You can adjust what percentage of the maximum available connections the proxy can use\. 
   +  You can select a session pinning filter\. This setting can help reduce performance issues due to insufficient transaction\-level reuse for connections\. Using this setting requires understanding of application behavior and the circumstances under which RDS Proxy pins a session to a database connection\. 
   +  You can adjust the connection borrow timeout interval\. This setting determines how long the proxy waits for a connection to become available before returning a timeout error, when the proxy already has the maximum number of connections being used\. 

1.  Choose **Modify target group**\. 

#### AWS CLI<a name="rds-proxy-modifying-proxy.cli"></a>

 To modify a proxy using the AWS CLI, you use the commands [modify\-db\-proxy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-proxy.html), [modify\-db\-proxy\-target\-group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-proxy-target-group.html), [deregister\-db\-proxy\-targets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/deregister-db-proxy-targets.html), and [register\-db\-proxy\-targets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/register-db-proxy-targets.html) 

 With the `modify-db-proxy` command, you can change properties such as the set of Secrets Manager secrets used by the proxy, whether TLS is required, the idle client timeout, whether to log additional information from SQL statements for debugging, the IAM role used to retrieve Secrets Manager secrets, and the security groups used by the proxy\. 

 The following example shows how to rename an existing proxy\. 

```
aws rds modify-db-proxy --db-proxy-name the-proxy --new-db-proxy-name the-new-name
```

 With the `modify-db-proxy-target-group` command, you can modify connection\-related settings or rename the target group\. Currently, all proxies have a single target group named `default`\. When working with this target group, you specify the name of the proxy and `default` for the name of the target group\. 

 The following example shows how to first check the `MaxConnectionsPercent` setting for a proxy and then change it, using the target group\. 

```
$ aws rds describe-db-proxy-target-groups --db-proxy-name the-proxy
{
    "TargetGroups": [
        {
            "Status": "available",
            "UpdatedDate": "2019-11-30T16:49:30.342Z",
            "ConnectionPoolConfig": {
                "MaxIdleConnectionsPercent": 50, 
                "ConnectionBorrowTimeout": 120,
                "MaxConnectionsPercent": 100,
                "SessionPinningFilters": []
            },
            "TargetGroupName": "default",
            "CreatedDate": "2019-11-30T16:49:27.940Z",
            "DBProxyName": "the-proxy",
            "IsDefault": true
        }
    ]
}

$ aws rds modify-db-proxy-target-group --db-proxy-name the-proxy --target-group-name default --connection-pool-config '{ "MaxIdleConnectionsPercent": 75 }'
{
    "DBProxyTargetGroup": {
        "Status": "available",
        "UpdatedDate": "2019-12-02T04:09:50.420Z",
        "ConnectionPoolConfig": {
            "MaxIdleConnectionsPercent": 75,
            "ConnectionBorrowTimeout": 120,
            "MaxConnectionsPercent": 100,
            "SessionPinningFilters": []
        },
        "TargetGroupName": "default",
        "CreatedDate": "2019-11-30T16:49:27.940Z",
        "DBProxyName": "the-proxy",
        "IsDefault": true
    }
}
```

 With the `deregister-db-proxy-targets` and `register-db-proxy-targets` commands, you change which RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster the proxy is associated with through its target group\. Currently, each proxy can connect to one RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster\. The target group tracks the connection details for all the RDS DB instances in a multi\-AZ configuration, or all the DB instances in an Aurora cluster\. 

 The following example starts with a proxy that is associated with an Aurora cluster named `cluster-56-2019-11-14-1399`\. The example shows how to change the proxy so that it can connect to a different cluster named `provisioned-cluster`\. When you work with an RDS DB instance, you specify the `--db-instance-identifier` option\. When you work with an Aurora DB cluster, you specify the `--db-cluster-identifier` option instead\. 

```
$ aws rds describe-db-proxy-targets --db-proxy-name the-proxy
{
    "Targets": [
        {
            "Endpoint": "instance-9814.demo.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
            "Type": "RDS_INSTANCE",
            "Port": 3306,
            "RdsResourceId": "instance-9814"
        },
        {
            "Endpoint": "instance-8898.demo.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
            "Type": "RDS_INSTANCE",
            "Port": 3306,
            "RdsResourceId": "instance-8898"
        },
        {
            "Endpoint": "instance-1018.demo.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
            "Type": "RDS_INSTANCE",
            "Port": 3306,
            "RdsResourceId": "instance-1018"
        },
        {
            "Type": "TRACKED_CLUSTER",
            "Port": 0,
            "RdsResourceId": "cluster-56-2019-11-14-1399"
        },
        {
            "Endpoint": "instance-4330.demo.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
            "Type": "RDS_INSTANCE",
            "Port": 3306,
            "RdsResourceId": "instance-4330"
        }
    ]
}

$ aws rds deregister-db-proxy-targets --db-proxy-name the-proxy --db-cluster-identifier cluster-56-2019-11-14-1399

$ aws rds describe-db-proxy-targets --db-proxy-name the-proxy
{
    "Targets": []
}

$ aws rds register-db-proxy-targets --db-proxy-name the-proxy --db-cluster-identifier provisioned-cluster
{
    "DBProxyTargets": [
        {
            "Type": "TRACKED_CLUSTER",
            "Port": 0,
            "RdsResourceId": "provisioned-cluster"
        },
        {
            "Endpoint": "gkldje.demo.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
            "Type": "RDS_INSTANCE",
            "Port": 3306,
            "RdsResourceId": "gkldje"
        },
        {
            "Endpoint": "provisioned-1.demo.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
            "Type": "RDS_INSTANCE",
            "Port": 3306,
            "RdsResourceId": "provisioned-1"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### RDS API<a name="rds-proxy-modifying-proxy.api"></a>

 To modify a proxy using the RDS API, you use the operations [ModifyDBProxy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyDBProxy.html), [ModifyDBProxyTargetGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyDBProxyTargetGroup.html), [DeregisterDBProxyTargets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DeregisterDBProxyTargets.html), and [RegisterDBProxyTargets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterDBProxyTargets.html) operations\. 

 With `ModifyDBProxy`, you can change properties such as the set of Secrets Manager secrets used by the proxy, whether TLS is required, the idle client timeout, whether to log additional information from SQL statements for debugging, the IAM role used to retrieve Secrets Manager secrets, and the security groups used by the proxy\. 

 With `ModifyDBProxyTargetGroup`, you can modify connection\-related settings or rename the target group\. Currently, all proxies have a single target group named `default`\. When working with this target group, you specify the name of the proxy and `default` for the name of the target group\. 

 With `DeregisterDBProxyTargets` and `RegisterDBProxyTargets`, you change which RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster the proxy is associated with through its target group\. Currently, each proxy can connect to one RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster\. The target group tracks the connection details for all the RDS DB instances in a multi\-AZ configuration, or all the DB instances in an Aurora cluster\. 

### Adding a New Database User<a name="rds-proxy-new-db-user"></a>

 In some cases, you might add a new database user to an RDS DB instance or Aurora cluster that's associated with a proxy\. If so, add or repurpose a Secrets Manager secret to store the credentials for that user\. To do this, choose one of the following options: 
+  Create a new Secrets Manager secret, using the procedure described in [Setting Up Database Credentials in AWS Secrets Manager](#rds-proxy-secrets-arns)\. 
+  If the new user takes the place of an existing one, update the credentials stored in the proxy's Secrets Manager secret for the existing user\. 

### Changing the Password for a Database User<a name="rds-proxy-changing-db-user-password"></a>

 In some cases, you might change the password for a database user in an RDS DB instance or Aurora cluster that's associated with a proxy\. If so, update the corresponding Secrets Manager secret with the new password\. 

## Connecting to a Database through RDS Proxy<a name="rds-proxy-connecting"></a>


|  | 
| --- |
| This is preview documentation for Amazon RDS Proxy\. It is subject to change\. | 

 You connect to an RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster through a proxy in generally the same way as you connect directly to the database\. The main difference is that you specify the proxy endpoint instead of the instance or cluster endpoint\. 

 For an Aurora DB cluster, all proxy connections have read\-write capability and use the writer instance\. If you use the reader endpoint for read\-only connections, you continue using the reader endpoint the same way\. 

### Connecting to a Proxy Using Native Authentication<a name="rds-proxy-connecting-native"></a>

 Use the following general procedure to connect to a proxy using native authentication: 
+  Find the proxy endpoint\. In the AWS Management Console, you can find the endpoint on the details page for the corresponding proxy\. With the AWS CLI, you can use the `describe-db-proxies` command\. The following example shows how: 

  ```
  # Add --output text to get output as a simple tab-separated list.
  $ aws rds describe-db-proxies --query '*[*].{DBProxyName:DBProxyName,Endpoint:Endpoint}'
  [
      [
          {
              "Endpoint": "the-proxy.proxy-demo.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
              "DBProxyName": "the-proxy"
          },
          {
              "Endpoint": "the-proxy-other-secret.proxy-demo.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
              "DBProxyName": "the-proxy-other-secret"
          },
          {
              "Endpoint": "the-proxy-rds-secret.proxy-demo.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
              "DBProxyName": "the-proxy-rds-secret"
          },
          {
              "Endpoint": "the-proxy-t3.proxy-demo.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
              "DBProxyName": "the-proxy-t3"
          }
      ]
  ]
  ```
+  Specify that endpoint as the host parameter in the connection string for your client application\. For example, specify the proxy endpoint as the parameter for the `mysql -h` option\. 
+  Supply the same database user name and password as you normally do\. 

### Connecting to a Proxy Using IAM Authentication<a name="rds-proxy-connecting-iam"></a>

 Follow the same general procedure as for connecting to an RDS DB instance or Aurora cluster using IAM authentication\. Instead of the instance, cluster, or reader endpoint, specify the proxy endpoint\. For details of that procedure, see [Connecting to Your DB Instance from the Command Line: AWS CLI and mysql Client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.Connecting.AWSCLI.html)\. 

## Managing RDS Proxy<a name="rds-proxy-managing"></a>

 The following explain aspects of RDS Proxy operation and configuration that help your application to make the most efficient use of database connections and achieve maximum connection reuse\. The more you can take advantage of connection reuse, the more CPU and memory overhead you can save\. This in turn reduces latency for your application and enables the database to devote more of its resources to processing application requests\. 

### Connection Limits and Timeouts<a name="rds-proxy-connection-limits"></a>

 RDS Proxy makes use of the `max_connections` setting for your RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster\. This setting represents the overall upper limit on the connections that the proxy can open at any one time\. In Aurora clusters and RDS multi\-AZ configurations, the `max_connections` value that the proxy uses is the one for the Aurora primary instance or the RDS writer instance\. 

 The proxy setting for maximum connections represents a percentage of the `max_connections` value\. If you have multiple applications all using the same database, you can effectively divide their connection quotas by using a proxy for each application with a specific percentage of `max_connections`\. If you do so, ensure that the percentages add up to 100 or less for all proxies associated with the same database\. 

 RDS Proxy periodically disconnects idle connections and returns them to the connection pool\. You can adjust this timeout interval\. Doing so helps your applications to deal with stale resources, especially if the application mistakenly leaves a connection open while holding important database resources\. 

### Connection Pooling<a name="rds-proxy-connection-pooling-tuning"></a>

 As described in [Connection Pooling](#rds-proxy-connection-pooling), connection pooling is a crucial RDS Proxy feature\. Following, you can learn how to make the most efficient use of connection pooling and transaction\-level connection reuse \(multiplexing\)\. 

 Because the connection pool is managed by RDS Proxy, you can monitor it and adjust connection limits and timeout intervals without changing your application code\. 

 For each proxy, you can specify an upper limit on the number of connections used by the connection pool\. You specify the limit as a percentage\. This percentage applies to the maximum connections configured in the database\. The exact number varies depending on the DB instance size and configuration settings\. For example, suppose that you configured RDS Proxy to use 75% of the maximum connections for the database\. For MySQL, the maximum value is defined by the `max_connections` configuration parameter\. In this case, the other 25% of maximum connections would remain available to assign to other proxies or for connections that don't go through a proxy\. If the database doesn't have many simultaneous connections, or some connections stay idle for long periods, the proxy might keep less than 75% of the maximum connections open at a particular time\. 

 The overall number of connections available for the connection pool changes as you update the `max_connections` configuration setting that applies to an RDS DB instance or a Aurora MySQL cluster\. 

 The proxy doesn't reserve all of these connections in advance\. Thus, you can specify a relatively large percentage, and those connections are only opened when the proxy becomes busy enough to need them\. 

 You can choose how long to wait for a connection to become available for use by your application\. This setting is represented by the **Connection borrow timeout** option when you create a proxy\. This setting specifies how long to wait for a connection to become available in the connection pool before returning a timeout error\. It applies when the number of connections is at the maximum, and so no connections are available in the connection pool\. IT also applies if no writer instance is available because a failover operation is in process\. This setting enables you to limit the wait period that is most suitable for your application without having to change the query timeout in your application code\. 

### Pinning<a name="rds-proxy-pinning"></a>

 Multiplexing is more efficient when database requests don't rely on state information from previous requests\. In that case, RDS Proxy can reuse a connection at the conclusion of each transaction\. Examples of such state information include most variables and configuration parameters that you can change through `SET` or `SELECT` statements\. SQL transactions on a client connection can multiplex between underlying database connections by default\. 

 Your connections to the proxy can enter a state known as *pinning*\. When a connection is pinned, each later transaction uses the same underlying database connection until the session ends\. RDS Proxy automatically pins a client connection to a specific DB connection when it detects a session state change that isn't appropriate for other sessions\. Pinning reduces the effectiveness of connection reuse\. If all or almost all of your connections experience pinning, you might modify your application code or workload to reduce the conditions that cause the pinning\. 

 For example, if your application changes a session variable or configuration parameter, later statements can rely on the new variable or parameter to be in effect\. Thus, when RDS Proxy processes requests to change session variables or configuration settings, it pins that session to the DB connection\. That way, the session state remains in effect for all later transactions in the same session\. This rule doesn't apply to all parameters you can set\. RDS Proxy tracks changes to the character set, collation, time zone, autocommit, current database, SQL mode, and `session_track_schema` settings\. RDS Proxy doesn't pin the session when you modify them\. In that case, RDS Proxy only reuses the connection for other sessions that have the same values for those settings\. 

 Performance tuning for RDS Proxy involves trying to maximize transaction\-level connection reuse \(multiplexing\) by minimizing pinning\. You can do so by using the following techniques: 
+  Avoid unnecessary database requests that could cause pinning\. 
+  Set variables and configuration settings consistently across all connections\. That way, later sessions are more likely to reuse connections that have those particular settings\. 
+  Apply a session pinning filter to the proxy\. You can exempt certain kinds of operations from pinning the session if you know that doing so doesn't affect the correct operation of your application\. 
+  Monitor the CloudWatch metric `DatabaseConnectionsCurrentlySessionPinned` to see how frequently pinning occurs\. For information about this and other CloudWatch metrics, see [Monitoring RDS ProxyMonitoring](#rds-proxy.monitoring)\. 
+  If you use `SET` statements to perform identical initialization for each client connection, you can do so while still preserving transaction\-level multiplexing\. In this case, you move the statements that set up the initial session state into the initialization query used by a proxy\. This property is a string containing one or more SQL statements, separated by semicolons\. For example, you can define an initialization query for a proxy that sets certain configuration parameters\. Then, RDS Proxy applies those settings whenever it sets up a new connection for that proxy\. You can remove the corresponding `SET` statements from your application code, so that they don't interfere with transaction\-level multiplexing\. You can work with the initialization query through the AWS CLI and RDS API\. Currently, you can't set this property through the AWS Management Console\. 

 The proxy pins the session to the current connection in the following situations where multiplexing might cause unexpected behavior: 
+  Any statement with a text size greater than 4 KB causes the proxy to pin the session\. 
+  Prepared statements cause the proxy to pin the session\. This rule applies whether the prepared statement uses SQL text or the binary protocol\. 
+  An explicit `LOCK TABLE`, `LOCK TABLES`, or `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK` statement causes the proxy to pin the session\. 
+  Setting a user variable or a system variable \(with some exceptions\) causes the proxy to pin the session\. If this situation reduces your connection reuse too much, you can choose for `SET` operations not to cause pinning\. 
+  Creating a temporary table causes the proxy to pin the session\. That way, the contents of the temporary table are preserved throughout the session regardless of transaction boundaries\. 
+  Calling the `ROW_COUNT()`, `FOUND_ROWS()`, or `LAST_INSERT_ID()` functions sometimes causes pinning and sometimes not\. The behavior might be different between Aurora MySQL versions that are compatible with MySQL 5\.6 and MySQL 5\.7\. 

 Calling stored procedures and stored functions doesn't cause pinning\. RDS Proxy doesn't detect any session state changes resulting from such calls\. Therefore, ensure your application doesn't change session state inside stored routines and rely on that session state to persist across transactions\. For example, if a stored procedure creates a temporary table that is intended to persist across transactions, that application currently isn't compatible with RDS Proxy\. 

 If you have expert knowledge about your application behavior, you can choose to skip the pinning behavior for certain application statements\. You do so by choosing the **Session pinning filters** option when creating the proxy\. Currently, you can opt out of session pinning for the following kinds of application statements: 
+  Setting session variables and configuration settings\.

 You can monitor RDS Proxy using Amazon CloudWatch\. CloudWatch collects and processes raw data from the proxies into readable, near real\-time metrics\. To find these metrics in the CloudWatch console, choose **Metrics**, then choose **RDS**, and choose **Per\-Proxy Metrics**\. 

**Note**  
 RDS publishes these metrics for each underlying EC2 instance associated with the proxy\. A single proxy might be served by more than one EC2 instance\. Use CloudWatch statistics to aggregate the values for a proxy across all the associated instances\. 

 All RDS Proxy metrics are in the group `proxy`, with a dimension of `ProxyName`\. 


|  Metric  |  Valid Period  |  Description  | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|   `ClientConnectionsReceived`   |   1 minute and above   |   The number of client connection requests received\. The most useful statistic for this metric is Sum\.   | 
|  ClientConnectionsSetupSucceeded  |   1 minute and above   |   The number of client connections successfully established with any authentication mechanism with or without TLS\. The most useful statistic for this metric is Sum\.   | 
|  ClientConnectionsSetupFailedAuth  |   1 minute and above   |   The number of client connection attempts which failed due to bad authentication or TLS misconfiguration\. The most useful statistic for this metric is Sum\.   |

## Limitations for RDS Proxy<a name="rds-proxy.limitations"></a>


|  | 
| --- |
| This is preview documentation for Amazon RDS Proxy\. It is subject to change\. | 

 The following limitations apply to RDS Proxy during the public preview: 
+   The public preview is available only in these AWS Regions: US East \(N\. Virginia\), US East \(Ohio\), US West \(Oregon\), Asia Pacific \(Tokyo\), and Europe \(Ireland\)\. 
+  You can have up to 20 proxies for each AWS account ID\. 
+  In an Aurora cluster, all of the connections in the connection pool are handled by the Aurora primary instance\. To perform load balancing for read\-intensive workloads, you still use the reader endpoint directly for the Aurora cluster\. 
+  Currently, RDS Proxy is only available for the MySQL engine family\. This engine family includes RDS MySQL 5\.6 and 5\.7, and Aurora versions 1 and 2\. Proxy support for PostgreSQL databases isn't available in the public preview\. 
+  You can't use RDS Proxy with RDS MySQL 8\.0\. 
+  You can't use RDS Proxy with Aurora Serverless clusters\. 
+  You can't use RDS Proxy with Aurora multi\-master clusters\. 
+  You can use RDS Proxy with Amazon RDS MySQL and Aurora MySQL\. You can't use it with self\-managed MySQL databases in EC2 instances\. 
+  Currently, all proxies listen on port 3306\. 
+  Your RDS Proxy must be in the same VPC as the database\. Although the database can be publicly accessible, the proxy can't be\. 
+  Currently, proxies don't track any changes to the set of DB instances within an Aurora DB cluster\. Those changes include operations such as host replacements, instance renames, port changes, scaling instances up or down, or adding or removing DB instances\. 
+  Not all logic is implemented to pin sessions to database connections based on SQL statements and functions\. For the most current pinning behavior, see [Pinning](#rds-proxy-pinning)\. 

## Command\-Line Examples for RDS Proxy<a name="rds-proxy.examples"></a>


|  |

| This is preview documentation for Amazon RDS Proxy\. It is subject to change\. | 

 To see how combinations of `mysql` connection commands and SQL statements interact with RDS Proxy, look at the following examples\. 

**Example Preserving Connections Across a Failover**  
 This example demonstrates how open connections continue working during a failover, for example when you reboot a database or it becomes unavailable due to a problem\. This example uses a proxy named `the-proxy` and an Aurora DB cluster with DB instances `instance-8898` and `instance-9814`\. When the `failover-db-cluster` command is run from the Linux command line, the writer instance that the proxy is connected to changes to a different DB instance\. You can see that the DB instance associated with the proxy changes while the connection remains open\.   

```
$ mysql -h the-proxy.proxy-demo.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin_user -p
Enter password:
...

mysql> select @@aurora_server_id;
+--------------------+
| @@aurora_server_id |
+--------------------+
| instance-9814      |
+--------------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

**Example Adjusting the max\_connections Setting for an Aurora DB Cluster**  
 This example demonstrates how you can adjust the `max_connections` setting for an Aurora MySQL DB cluster\. To do so, you create your own DB cluster parameter group based on the default parameter settings for clusters that are compatible with MySQL 5\.6 or 5\.7\. You specify a value for the `max_connections` setting, overriding the formula that sets the default value\. You associate the DB cluster parameter group with your DB cluster\.   

```
export REGION=us-east-1
export CLUSTER_PARAM_GROUP=rds-proxy-mysql-56-max-connections-demo
export CLUSTER_NAME=rds-proxy-mysql-56

aws rds create-db-parameter-group --region $REGION \
  --db-parameter-group-family aurora5.6 \
  --db-parameter-group-name $CLUSTER_PARAM_GROUP \
  --description "Aurora MySQL 5.6 cluster parameter group for RDS Proxy demo."

aws rds modify-db-cluster --region $REGION \
  --db-cluster-identifier $CLUSTER_NAME \
  --db-cluster-parameter-group-name $CLUSTER_PARAM_GROUP

echo "New cluster param group is assigned to cluster:"
aws rds describe-db-clusters --region $REGION \
  --db-cluster-identifier $CLUSTER_NAME \
  --query '*[*].{DBClusterParameterGroup:DBClusterParameterGroup}'

echo "Current value for max_connections:"
aws rds describe-db-cluster-parameters --region $REGION \
  --db-cluster-parameter-group-name $CLUSTER_PARAM_GROUP \
  --query '*[*].{ParameterName:ParameterName,ParameterValue:ParameterValue}' \
  --output text | grep "^max_connections"

echo -n "Enter number for max_connections setting: "
read answer

aws rds modify-db-cluster-parameter-group --region $REGION --db-cluster-parameter-group-name $CLUSTER_PARAM_GROUP \
  --parameters "ParameterName=max_connections,ParameterValue=$$answer,ApplyMethod=immediate"

echo "Updated value for max_connections:"
aws rds describe-db-cluster-parameters --region $REGION \
  --db-cluster-parameter-group-name $CLUSTER_PARAM_GROUP \
  --query '*[*].{ParameterName:ParameterName,ParameterValue:ParameterValue}' \
  --output text | grep "^max_connections"
```

## Troubleshooting for RDS Proxy<a name="rds-proxy.troubleshooting"></a>


|  | 
| --- |
| This is preview documentation for Amazon RDS Proxy\. It is subject to change\. | 

### Common Issues and Solutions<a name="rds-proxy-diagnosis"></a>

 You can refer to the following list of symptoms to see the possible causes and solutions to problems you might encounter using RDS Proxy\. During the public preview, error handling code isn't complete, so you might experience cryptic error messages from underlying services\. 

 You might encounter the following issues while creating a new proxy\. 


****  

|  Error or Symptom  |  Causes or Workarounds  | 
| --- | --- | 
|   `403: The security token included in the request is invalid`   |  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy.html)  | 

 You might encounter the following issues while connecting to a proxy\. 


****  

|  Error or Symptom  |  Causes or Workarounds  | 
| --- | --- | 
|   `ERROR 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on 'proxy_endpoint' (110)`   |   The proxy endpoint exists, but couldn't establish a connection to the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster\. This error typically occurs after a timeout period\. Some possible reasons include the following:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy.html)  | 
|   `ERROR 2005 (HY000): Unknown MySQL server host 'proxy_endpoint' (0)`   |   The proxy endpoint doesn't exist\. This error typically occurs immediately\. Some possible reasons include the following:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy.html)  | 
|   `ERROR 2013 (HY000): Lost connection to MySQL server at 'reading initial communication packet', system error: 2`   |   The proxy couldn't log into the database using the credentials from the Secrets Manager secrets\. Some possible reasons include the following:  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-proxy.html)  | 

### CloudWatch Logs<a name="rds-proxy-logs"></a>

 You can find logs of RDS Proxy activity under CloudWatch in the AWS Management Console\. Each proxy has an entry in the **Log groups** page\. 

**Important**  
 These logs are intended for human consumption for troubleshooting purposes and not for programmatic access\. The format and content of the logs is subject to change \(especially during preview\)\. 

### Verifying Connectivity to a Proxy<a name="rds-proxy-verifying"></a>

 You can use the following commands to verify that all components of the connection mechanism can communicate with the other components\. 

 Examine the proxy itself\. Also examine the associated target groups and the targets specified in the target groups\. Check that the details of the targets match the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster that you intend to associate with the proxy\. 

```
aws rds describe-db-proxies --db-proxy-name $DB_PROXY_NAME
aws rds describe-db-proxy-target-groups --db-proxy-name $DB_PROXY_NAME
aws rds describe-db-proxy-targets --db-proxy-name $DB_PROXY_NAME
```

 If the following `nc` command reports success, you can access the proxy endpoint from the EC2 instance or other system where you're logged in\. This command reports failure if you're not in the same VPC as the proxy and the associated database\. You might be able to log directly in to the database without being in the same VPC\. However, you can't log into the proxy unless you're in the same VPC\. 

```
nc -zx proxy_endpoint 3306
```

 You can use the following commands to make sure that your EC2 instance has the required properties\. In particular, the VPC for the EC2 instance must be the same as the VPC for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster that the proxy connects to\. 

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids your_ec2_instance_id
```

 Examine the Secrets Manager secrets used for the proxy\. 

```
aws secretsmanager list-secrets
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id your_secret_id
```

 Make sure that the `SecretString` field displayed by `get-secret-value` is encoded as a JSON string that includes `username` and `password` fields\. The following example shows the format of the `SecretString` field\. 

```
{
  "ARN": "some_arn",
  "Name": "some_name",
  "VersionId": "some_version_id",
  "SecretString": "{\"username\":\"some_username\",\"password\":\"some_password\"}",
  "VersionStages": [ "some_stage" ],
  "CreatedDate": some_timestamp
}
```

 Examine the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster that you associated with the proxy\. For an Aurora DB cluster, also examine each of the DB instances in the cluster\. Make sure that their properties match what's expected for the proxy, such as the port being 3306\. 

```
aws rds describe-db-clusters --db-cluster-id $DB_CLUSTER_ID
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-id $DB_INSTANCE_ID1
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-id $DB_INSTANCE_ID2
```

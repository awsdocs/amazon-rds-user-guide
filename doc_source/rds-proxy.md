# Managing Connections with Amazon RDS Proxy \(Preview\)<a name="rds-proxy"></a>

****  
***This is preview documentation for Amazon RDS Proxy\. It is subject to change\.***

By using Amazon RDS Proxy, you can allow your applications to pool and share database connections to improve scalability\. RDS Proxy makes applications more resilient to database failures by automatically connecting to a standby DB instance while preserving application connections\. RDS Proxy also enables you to enforce AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) authentication for databases, and securely store credentials in AWS Secrets Manager\.

**Note**  
RDS Proxy is fully compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL\. You can enable RDS Proxy for most applications with no code changes\. 

Using RDS Proxy, you can handle unpredictable surges in database traffic that otherwise could cause issues due to oversubscribing connections or creating new connections at a fast rate\. RDS Proxy establishes a database connection pool and reuses connections in this pool without the memory and CPU overhead of opening a new database connection each time\. To protect the database against oversubscription, you can control the number of database connections that are created\. 

RDS Proxy sequences or throttles application connections that can't be served immediately from the pool of connections\. Although latencies might increase, your application can continue to scale without abruptly failing or overwhelming the database\. If connection requests exceed the limits you specify, RDS Proxy rejects application connections \(sheds load\)\. At the same time, it maintains predictable performance for the load that can be served with available capacity\. 

 You can reduce the overhead to process credentials and establish a secure connection for each new connection\. RDS Proxy can handle some of that work on behalf of the database\. 

**Important**  
 Currently, Amazon RDS Proxy is in preview\. Don't use RDS Proxy for production workloads\. Also, we strongly recommend not putting sensitive data in databases that you use with RDS Proxy preview\. You might encounter issues during the preview that cause incorrect results, corrupted data, or both\. Over the duration of the preview, we might introduce breaking changes without advance notice\. These might include upgrades and changes to our API operations\.

## RDS Proxy Concepts and Terminology<a name="rds-proxy.howitworks"></a>

****  
***This is preview documentation for Amazon RDS Proxy\. It is subject to change\.***

 You can simplify connection management for your Amazon RDS DB instances and Aurora DB clusters by using RDS Proxy\. 

 RDS Proxy handles the network traffic between the client application and the database\. It does so in an active way first by understanding the database protocol\. It then adjusts its behavior based on the SQL operations from your application and the result sets from the database\. RDS Proxy reduces the memory and CPU overhead for connection management on your database\. The database needs less memory and CPU resources when applications open many simultaneous connections\. It also doesn't require logic in your applications to close and reopen connections that stay idle for a long time\. Similarly, it requires less application logic to reestablish connections in case of a database problem\. 

 The infrastructure for RDS Proxy is independent of the database servers for the RDS DB instances and Aurora DB clusters\. This separation helps lower overhead on your database servers, so that they can devote their resources to serving database workloads\.

### Overview of RDS Proxy Terminology<a name="rds-proxy-overview"></a>

 RDS Proxy handles the infrastructure to perform connection pooling and the other features described in this documentation\. You see the proxies represented in the AWS Management Console for RDS on the **Proxies** page\. 

 Each proxy handles connections to a single RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster\. The proxy determines the current writer instance for RDS multi\-AZ DB instances and Aurora provisioned clusters\.  

 The connections that a proxy keeps open and available for your database application to use form the *connection pool*\. 

 By default, RDS Proxy can reuse a connection after each transaction in your session\. This transaction\-level reuse is called *multiplexing*\. In some cases, RDS Proxy can't be sure that it's safe to run different transactions from a session using different connections\. In these cases, it keeps the session on the same connection until the session ends\. This fallback behavior is called *pinning*\. 

A proxy has an endpoint\. You connect to this endpoint when you work with an RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster, instead of connecting to the read\-write endpoint that connects directly to the instance or cluster\. The special\-purpose endpoints for an Aurora cluster remain available for you to use\. For example, you can still connect to the cluster endpoint for read\-write connections without connection pooling\. You can still connect to the reader endpoint for load\-balanced read\-only connections\. You can still connect to the instance endpoints for diagnosis and troubleshooting of specific DB instances within an Aurora cluster\. If you are using other AWS services such as AWS Lambda to connect to RDS databases, you change their connection settings to use the proxy endpoint\. For example, you specify the proxy endpoint to allow Lambda functions to access your database while taking advantage of RDS Proxy functionality\. 

 Each proxy contains a target group\. This *target group* embodies the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster that the proxy can connect to\. For an Aurora cluster, by default the target group is associated with all the DB instances in that cluster\. That way, the proxy can connect to whichever Aurora DB instance is promoted to be the writer instance in the cluster\. The RDS DB instance associated with a proxy, or the Aurora DB cluster and its instances, are referred to as the *targets* of that proxy\. For convenience, when you create a proxy through the AWS Management Console, RDS Proxy also creates the corresponding target group and registers the associated targets automatically\. 

 An *engine family* is a related set of database engines that use the same DB protocol\. You choose the engine family for each proxy that you create\. For a global database, you can create a proxy for the primary AWS Region, but not for a read\-only secondary AWS Region\. 

### Connection Pooling<a name="rds-proxy-connection-pooling"></a>

 Each proxy performs connection pooling for the writer instance of its associated RDS or Aurora database\. *Connection pooling* is an optimization that reduces the overhead associated with opening and closing connections and with keeping many connections open simultaneously\. This overhead includes memory needed to handle each new connection\. It also involves CPU overhead to close each connection and open a new one, such as Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer \(TLS/SSL\) handshaking, authentication, negotiating capabilities, and so on\. Connection pooling simplifies your application logic\. You don't need to write application code to minimize the number of simultaneous open connections\. 

 Each proxy also performs connection multiplexing, also known as connection reuse\. With *multiplexing*, RDS Proxy perform all the operations for a transaction using one underlying database connection, then can use a different connection for the next transaction\. You can open many simultaneous connections to the proxy, and the proxy keeps a smaller number of connections open to the DB instance or cluster\. Doing so further minimizes the memory overhead for connections on the database server\. This technique also reduces the chance of "too many connections" errors\. 

### RDS Proxy Security<a name="rds-proxy-security"></a>

 RDS Proxy uses the existing RDS security mechanisms such as Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer \(TLS/SSL\) and AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)\. For general information about those security features, see [Security in Amazon RDS](UsingWithRDS.md)\. If you aren't familiar with how RDS and Aurora work with authentication, authorization, and other areas of security, consult those resources first\. 

 RDS Proxy can act as an additional layer of security between client applications and the underlying database\. For example, you can connect to the proxy using TLS 1\.2, even if the underlying DB instance only supports TLS 1\.0 or 1\.1\. You can connect to the proxy using an IAM role, even if the proxy connects to the database using the native user/password authentication method\. By using this technique, you can enforce strong authentication requirements for database applications without a costly migration effort for the DB instances themselves\. 

 You store the database credentials used by RDS Proxy in AWS Secrets Manager\. Each database user for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster accessed by a proxy must have a corresponding secret in Secrets Manager\. You can also set up IAM authentication for users of RDS Proxy\. By doing so, you can enforce IAM authentication for database access even if the databases still use native password authentication\. These security features are a preferable alternative to embedding database credentials in your application code\. 

#### Using TLS/SSL with RDS Proxy<a name="rds-proxy-security.tls"></a>

 You can connect to RDS Proxy using the TLS/SSL protocol\. 

**Note**  
 RDS Proxy uses certificates from the AWS Certificate Manager \(ACM\)\. If you are using RDS Proxy, when you rotate your TLS/SSL certificate, you don't need to update applications that use RDS Proxy connections\. 

 RDS Proxy can ensure that your session uses TLS/SSL between your client and the RDS Proxy endpoint\. To have RDS Proxy do so, specify the requirement on the client side with the `--ssl-mode` parameter\. SSL session variables are not set for SSL connections to a RDS Proxy database\. 

 RDS Proxy supports TLS protocol version 1\.0, 1\.1, and 1\.2\. However, you don't need to configure RDS Proxy database for TLS\. In particular, don't use the `REQUIRE` clause on your database user privileges for SSL\. Doing so prevents that user from connecting\. 

 By default, client programs establish an encrypted connection with RDS Proxy, with further control available through the `--ssl-mode` option\. From the client side, RDS Proxy supports all SSL modes\. 

 For the client, the SSL modes are the following: 

**PREFERRED**  
 SSL is the first choice, but it isn't required\. 

**DISABLED**  
 No SSL is allowed\. 

**REQUIRED**  
 Enforce SSL\. 

**VERIFY\_CA**  
 Enforce SSL and verify the certificate authority \(CA\)\. 

**VERIFY\_IDENTITY**  
 Enforce SSL and verify the CA and CA hostname\. 

 When using a client with `--ssl-mode` `VERIFY_CA` or `VERIFY_IDENTITY`, specify the `--ssl-ca` option pointing to a CA in \.pem format\. For a \.pem file that you can use, download the [Amazon Root CA 1 trust store](https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA1.pem) from Amazon Trust Services\. 

 RDS Proxy uses wildcard certificates, which apply to a both a domain and its subdomains\. If you use the `mysql` client to connect with SSL mode `VERIFY_IDENTITY`, currently you must use the MySQL 8\.0\-compatible `mysql` command\.

### Failover<a name="rds-proxy-failover"></a>

 Failover is a high\-availability feature that replaces a database instance with another one when the original instance becomes unavailable\. A failover might happen because of a problem with a database instance\. It could also be part of normal maintenance procedures, such as during a database upgrade\. Failover applies to RDS DB instances in a multi\-AZ configuration, and Aurora DB clusters with one or more reader instances in addition to the writer instance\. 

 Connecting through a proxy makes your application more resilient to database failovers\. When the original DB instance becomes unavailable, RDS Proxy connects to the standby database without dropping idle application connections\. Doing so helps to speed up and simplify the failover process\. The result is faster failover that's less disruptive to your application than a typical reboot or database problem\. 

 Without RDS Proxy, a failover involves a brief outage\. During the outage, you can't perform write operations on that database\. Any existing database connections are disrupted and your application must reopen them\. The database becomes available for new connections and write operations when a read\-only DB instance is promoted to take the place of the one that's unavailable\. 

During DB failovers, RDS Proxy continues to accept connections at the same IP address and automatically directs connections to the new master\. Clients connecting through RDS Proxy are not susceptible to the following: 
+ DNS propagation delays on failover\.
+ Local DNS caching\.
+ Connection timeouts\.
+ Uncertainty about which DB instance is the current writer\.
+ Waiting for a query response from a former writer that became unavailable without closing connections\. 

 For applications that maintain their own connection pool, going through RDS Proxy means that most connections stay alive during failovers or other disruptions\. Only connections that are in the middle of a transaction or SQL statement are cancelled\. RDS Proxy immediately accepts new connections\. When the database writer is unavailable, RDS Proxy queues up incoming requests\. 

 For applications that don't maintain their own connection pools, RDS Proxy offers faster connection rates and more open connections\. It offloads the expensive overhead of frequent reconnects from the database\. It does so by reusing database connections maintained in the RDS Proxy connection pool\. This approach is particularly important for TLS connections, where setup costs are significant\. 

### Transactions<a name="rds-proxy-transactions"></a>

 All the statements within a single transaction always use the same underlying database connection\. The connection becomes available for use by a different session when the transaction ends\. Using the transaction as the unit of granularity has the following consequences: 
+  Connection reuse can happen after each individual statement when the `autocommit` setting is enabled\. 
+  Conversely, when the `autocommit` setting is disabled, the first statement you issue in a session begins a new transaction\. Thus, if you enter a sequence of `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and other data manipulation language \(DML\) statements, connection reuse doesn't happen until you issue a `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, or otherwise end the transaction\. 
+  Entering a data definition language \(DDL\) statement causes the transaction to end after that statement completes\. 

 RDS Proxy detects when a transaction ends through the network protocol used by the database client application\. Transaction detection doesn't rely on keywords such as `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` appearing in the text of the SQL statement\. 

In some cases, RDS Proxy might detect a database request that makes it impractical to move your session to a different connection\. In these cases, it turns off multiplexing for that connection the remainder of your session\. The same rule applies if RDS Proxy can't be certain that multiplexing is practical for the session\. This operation is called *pinning*\. For ways to detect and minimize pinning, see [Avoiding Pinning](#rds-proxy-pinning)\.

### Limitations for RDS Proxy<a name="rds-proxy.limitations"></a>

****  
***This is preview documentation for Amazon RDS Proxy\. It is subject to change\.***

The following limitations apply to RDS Proxy during the public preview: 
+   The public preview is available only in these AWS Regions: 
  + US East \(N\. Virginia\) Region
  + US East \(Ohio\) Region
  + US West \(N\. California\) Region
  + US West \(Oregon\) Region
  + Asia Pacific \(Mumbai\) Region
  + Asia Pacific \(Seoul\) Region
  + Asia Pacific \(Singapore\) Region
  + Asia Pacific \(Sydney\) Region
  + Asia Pacific \(Tokyo\) Region
  + Canada \(Central\) Region
  + Europe \(Frankfurt\) Region
  + Europe \(Ireland\) Region
  + Europe \(London\) Region
+  You can have up to 20 proxies for each AWS account ID\. 
+  Each proxy can have up to 200 associated Secrets Manager secrets\. Thus, each proxy can connect to with up to 200 different user accounts at any given time\. 
+  In an Aurora cluster, all of the connections in the connection pool are handled by the Aurora writer instance\. To perform load balancing for read\-intensive workloads, you still use the reader endpoint directly for the Aurora cluster\. 
+ You can't use RDS Proxy with Aurora Serverless clusters\. 
+  You can't use RDS Proxy with Aurora multi\-master clusters\. 
+  Your RDS Proxy must be in the same VPC as the database\. The proxy can't be publicly accessible, although the database can be\. 
+  You can't use proxy with custom DNS\. 
+  RDS Proxy is available for the MySQL and PostgreSQL engine families\. 

The following RDS Proxy limitations apply to MySQL: 
+ The MySQL engine family includes RDS MySQL 5\.6 and 5\.7, and Aurora MySQL versions 1 and 2\.
+ Currently, all proxies listen on port 3306 for MySQL\.
+ Within the MySQL engine family, currently RDS Proxy supports Aurora provisioned clusters, Aurora parallel query clusters, and Aurora Global Databases\.
+ You can't use RDS Proxy with RDS MySQL 8\.0\. 
+ You can't use RDS Proxy with self\-managed MySQL databases in EC2 instances\. 
+ Proxies don't support MySQL compressed mode\. For example, they don't support the compression used by the `--compress` or `-C` options of the `mysql` command\.
+  Not all logic is implemented to pin sessions to database connections based on SQL statements and functions\. For the most current pinning behavior, see [Avoiding Pinning](#rds-proxy-pinning)\. 

The following RDS Proxy limitations apply to PostgreSQL: 
+  The RDS PostgreSQL engine family includes version 10\.10 and higher minor versions and version 11\.5 and higher minor versions\.
+ Currently, all proxies listen on port 5432 for PostgreSQL\.
+ Query cancellation isn't supported for PostgreSQL\.
+ The results of the PostgreSQL function [lastval\(\) ](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-sequence.html) aren't always accurate\. As a work around, use the [INSERT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-insert.html) statement with the `RETURNING` clause\.

### Identifying DB Instances, Clusters, and Applications to Use with RDS Proxy<a name="rds-proxy-planning"></a>

 You can determine which of your DB instances, clusters, and applications might benefit the most from using RDS Proxy\. To do so, consider these factors: 
+  RDS Proxy is highly available and deployed over multiple availability zones \(AZs\)\. To ensure overall high availability for your database, deploy your Amazon RDS DB instance or Aurora cluster in a multi\-AZ configuration\. 
+  Any DB instance or cluster that ever encounters "too many connections" errors is a good candidate for associating with a proxy\. The proxy enables applications to open many client connections, while the proxy manages a smaller number of long\-lived connections to the DB instance or cluster\. 
+  For DB instances or clusters that use smaller AWS instance classes, such as T2 or T3, using a proxy can help avoid out\-of\-memory conditions\. It can also help reduce the CPU overhead for establishing connections\. These conditions can occur when dealing with large numbers of connections\. 
+  You can monitor certain Amazon CloudWatch metrics to determine whether a DB instance or cluster is approaching certain types of limit\. These limits are for the number of connections and the memory associated with connection management\. You can also monitor certain CloudWatch metrics to determine whether a DB instance or cluster is handling many short\-lived connections\. Opening and closing such connections can impose performance overhead on your database\. For information about the metrics to monitor, see [Monitoring RDS Proxy Using Amazon CloudWatchMonitoring RDS Proxy](#rds-proxy.monitoring)\. 
+  AWS Lambda functions can also be good candidates for using a proxy\. These functions make frequent short database connections that benefit from connection pooling offered by RDS Proxy\. You can take advantage of any IAM authentication you already have for Lambda functions, instead of managing database credentials in your Lambda application code\. 
+  Applications that use languages and frameworks such as PHP and Ruby on Rails are typically good candidates for using a proxy\. Such applications typically open and close large numbers of database connections, and don't have built\-in connection pooling mechanisms\. 
+  Applications that keep a large number of connections open for long periods are typically good candidates for using a proxy\. Applications in industries such as software as a service \(SaaS\) or ecommerce often minimize the latency for database requests by leaving connections open\. 
+  You might not have adopted IAM authentication and Secrets Manager due to the complexity of setting up such authentication for all DB instances and clusters\. If so, you can leave the existing authentication methods in place and delegate the authentication to a proxy\. The proxy can enforce the authentication policies for client connections for particular applications\. You can take advantage of any IAM authentication you already have for Lambda functions, instead of managing database credentials in your Lambda application code\. 

### Setting Up Network Prerequisites<a name="rds-proxy-network-prereqs"></a>

 Using RDS Proxy requires you to have a set of networking resources in place\. These include a virtual private cloud \(VPC\), two or more subnets, an Amazon EC2 instance within the same VPC, and an internet gateway\. If you've successfully connected to any RDS DB instances or Aurora DB clusters, you already have the required network resources\.  

### Setting Up Database Credentials in AWS Secrets Manager<a name="rds-proxy-secrets-arns"></a>

 For each proxy that you create, you first use the Secrets Manager service to store sets of user name and password credentials\. You create a separate Secrets Manager secret for each database user account that the proxy connects to on the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster\. 

 In Secrets Manager, you create these secrets with the `username` and `password` fields\. Doing so allows the proxy to connect to the corresponding database users on whichever RDS DB instances or Aurora DB clusters that you associate with the proxy\. To do this, you can use the setting **Credentials for other database**, **Credentials for RDS database**, or **Other type of secrets**\. 

 The proxy ignores other fields such as `host` and `port` if they're present in the secret\. Those details are automatically supplied by the proxy\. If you choose **Credentials for other database**, that option prompts you for the user name and password, but not the other connection details, which you specify in the settings for the proxy itself\. If you choose **Other type of secrets**, you create the secret with keys named `username` and `password`\. 

 Don't choose any rotation period for the secrets\. 

 Because the secrets aren't tied to a specific database server, you can reuse a secret across multiple proxies if you use the same credentials across multiple database servers\. For example, you might use the same credentials across a group of development and test servers\. 

 If a password associated with a secret is incorrect, you can update the associated secret in Secrets Manager\. For example, you might update the secret if the password for the database account changes\. Until you update the secret, you can't connect through the proxy to that database account\. You can still connect to other accounts where the passwords match the credentials stored in the secrets\. 

 When you create a proxy through the AWS CLI or RDS API, you specify the Amazon Resource Names \(ARNs\) of the corresponding secrets for all the DB user accounts that the proxy can access\. In the AWS Management Console, you choose the secrets by their descriptive names\. 

 For instructions about creating secrets in Secrets Manager, see the [Creating a Secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_create-basic-secret.html) page in the Secrets Manager documentation\. Use one of the following techniques\. For instructions about creating secrets in Secrets Manager, see [Creating a Secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_create-basic-secret.html) in the *AWS Secrets Manager User Guide*\. Use one of the following techniques: 
+  Use [Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) in the console\. 
+  To use the CLI to create a Secrets Manager secret for use with RDS Proxy, use a command such as the following\.

  ```
  aws secretsmanager create-secret
    --name "secret_name"
    --description "secret_description"
    --region region_name
    --secret-string '{"username":"db_user","password":"db_user_password"}'
  ```

 For example, the following commands create Secrets Manager secrets for two database users, one named `admin` and the other named `app-user`\.

```
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name $ADMIN_SECRET --description "db admin user" \
  --secret-string '{"username":"admin","password":"choose_your_own_password"}'

aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name $PROXY_SECRET --description "application user" \
  --secret-string '{"username":"app-user","password":"choose_your_own_password"}'
```

### Setting Up AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) Policies<a name="rds-proxy-iam-setup"></a>

 After you create the secrets in Secrets Manager, you create an IAM policy that can access those secrets\. 
+  Follow the **Create Role** process\. Include the **Add Role to Database** step\. 
+  For the new role, perform the **Add inline policy** step\. Paste the following JSON, substituting the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) for the secret that you created\. 

  ```
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "secretsmanager:GetRandomPassword",
                  "secretsmanager:CreateSecret",
                  "secretsmanager:ListSecrets"
              ],
              "Resource": "*"
          },
          {
              "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": "secretsmanager:*",
              "Resource": [
                       "your_secret_ARN"
              ]
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
+  Optionally, edit the trust policy for this IAM policy\. Paste the following JSON\. 

  ```
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "Service": "rds.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

 The following commands perform the same operation through the AWS CLI\. 

```
PREFIX=choose_an_identifier

aws iam create-role --role-name choose_role_name \
  --assume-role-policy-document '{"Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":[{"Effect":"Allow","Principal":{"Service":["rds.amazonaws.com"]},"Action":"sts:AssumeRole"}]}'
aws iam put-role-policy --role-name same_role_name_as_previous \
  --policy-name $PREFIX-secret-reader-policy --policy-document '{"Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":[{"Sid":"getsecretvalue","Effect":"Allow","Action":["secretsmanager:GetSecretValue","kms:Decrypt"],"Resource":"*"}]}'

aws kms create-key --description "$PREFIX-test-key" --policy '{"Id":"$PREFIX-kms-policy","Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":[{"Sid":"Enable IAM User Permissions","Effect":"Allow","Principal":{"AWS":"arn:aws:iam::account_id:root"},"Action":"kms:*","Resource":"*"},{"Sid":"Allow access for Key Administrators","Effect":"Allow","Principal":{"AWS":["$USER_ARN","arn:aws:iam::account_id:role/Admin"]},"Action":["kms:Create*","kms:Describe*","kms:Enable*","kms:List*","kms:Put*","kms:Update*","kms:Revoke*","kms:Disable*","kms:Get*","kms:Delete*","kms:TagResource","kms:UntagResource","kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion","kms:CancelKeyDeletion"],"Resource":"*"},{"Sid":"Allow use of the key","Effect":"Allow","Principal":{"AWS":"$ROLE_ARN"},"Action":["kms:Decrypt","kms:DescribeKey"],"Resource":"*"}]}'
```

### Creating an RDS Proxy<a name="rds-proxy-creating"></a>

 To manage connections for a specified set of DB instances, you can create a proxy\. You can associate a proxy with an RDS MySQL DB instance, PostgreSQL DB instance, or an Aurora DB cluster\. 

#### AWS Management Console<a name="rds-proxy-creating.console"></a>

**To create a proxy**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1.  In the navigation pane, choose **Proxies**\. 

1.  Choose **Create proxy**\. 

1.  Choose all the settings for your proxy\. For the public preview, some choices are restricted or required\. Consider the following guidance: 

    **Proxy configuration**: 
   +  **Proxy identifier**\. Specify a name of your choosing, unique within your AWS account ID and current AWS Region\. 
   +  **Engine compatibility**\. Choose either **MySQL** or **POSTGRESQL**\. 
   +  **Require Transport Layer Security**\. Choose this setting if you want the proxy to enforce TLS / SSL for all client connections\. When you use an encrypted or unencrypted connection to a proxy, the proxy uses the same encryption setting when it makes a connection to the underlying database\. 
   +  **Idle client connection timeout**\. Choose a time period that a client connection can be idle before the proxy can close it\. The default is 1800 seconds \(30 minutes\)\. A client connection is considered idle when the application doesn't submit a new request within the specified time after the previous request completed\. The underlying database connection stays open and is returned to the connection pool\. Thus, it's available to be reused for new client connections\.

     Consider lowering the idle client connection timeout if you want the proxy to proactively remove stale connections\. If your workload is spiking, consider raising the idle client connection timeout to save the cost of establishing connections\.

    **Target group configuration**: 
   +  **Database**\. Choose one RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster to access through this proxy\. The list only includes DB instances and clusters with compatible database engines, engine versions, and other settings\. If the list is empty, create a new DB instance or cluster that's compatible with RDS Proxy\. Then try creating the proxy again\. 
   +  **Connection pool maximum connections**\. Specify a value between 1 and 100\. This setting represents the percentage of the `max_connections` value that RDS Proxy can use for its connections\. If you only intend to use one proxy with this DB instance or cluster, you can set it to 100\. For details about how RDS Proxy uses this setting, see [Controlling Connection Limits and Timeouts](#rds-proxy-connection-limits)\. 
   +  **Session pinning filters**\. This is an advanced setting, for troubleshooting performance issues with particular applications\. Currently, the only choice is `EXCLUDE_VARIABLE_SETS`\. Choose a filter only if your application isn't reusing connections due to certain kinds of SQL statements and you can verify that reusing connections with those SQL statements doesn't affect application correctness\. For more information, see [Avoiding Pinning](#rds-proxy-pinning)\.
   +  **Connection borrow timeout**\. In some cases, you might expect the proxy to sometimes use up all available connections\. In such cases, you can specify how long the proxy waits for a connection to become available before returning a timeout error\. This setting only applies when the proxy has the maximum number of connections open and all connections are already in use\. 

    **Connectivity**: 
   +  **Secrets Manager ARNs**\. Choose at least one Secrets Manager secret associated with the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster that you intend to access with this proxy\. 
   +  **IAM role**\. Choose an IAM role that has permission to access the Secrets Manager secrets you chose earlier\. You can also choose for the AWS Management Console to create a new IAM role for you and use that\. 
   +  **IAM Authentication**\. Choose whether to require or disallow IAM authentication for connections to your proxy\. 
   +  **Subnets**\. This field is prepopulated with all the subnets associated with your VPC\. You can remove any subnets that you don't need for this proxy\. Make sure that you leave at least two subnets\. 

    **Additional connectivity configuration**: 
   +  **VPC security group**\. Choose an existing VPC security group\. You can also choose for the AWS Management Console to create a new security group for you and use that\. 

    **Advanced configuration**: 
   +  **Enable enhanced logging**\. You can enable this setting to troubleshoot proxy compatibility or performance issues\. When this setting is enabled, RDS Proxy includes detailed information about SQL statements in its logs\. This information helps you to debug issues involving SQL behavior or the performance and scalability of the proxy connections\. The debug information includes the text of SQL statements that you submit through the proxy\. Thus, only enable this setting when needed for debugging, and only when you have security measures in place to safeguard any sensitive information that appears in the logs\. 

1.  Select **RDS Proxy is now available in Preview** to acknowledge the terms and conditions for the preview\. 

1.  Choose **Create Proxy**\. 

#### AWS CLI<a name="rds-proxy-creating.CLI"></a>

 To create a proxy, use the AWS CLI command [ `create-db-proxy`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-proxy.html)\. Note the `--engine-family` value is case sensitive\.

**Example**  
For Linux, macOS, or Unix:  

```
aws rds create-db-proxy \
    --db-proxy-name proxy_name \
    --role-arn iam_role \
    --engine-family { MYSQL | POSTGRESQL } \
    --vpc-subnet-ids space_separated_list \
    [--vpc-security-group-ids space_separated_list] \
    [--auth ProxyAuthenticationConfig_JSON_string] \
    [--require-tls | --no-require-tls] \
    [--idle-client-timeout value] \
    [--debug-logging | --no-debug-logging] \
    [--tags comma_separated_list]
```
For Windows:  

```
aws rds create-db-proxy ^
    --db-proxy-name proxy_name ^
    --role-arn iam_role ^
    --engine-family { MYSQL | POSTGRESQL } ^
    --vpc-subnet-ids space_separated_list ^
    [--vpc-security-group-ids space_separated_list] ^
    [--auth ProxyAuthenticationConfig_JSON_string] ^
    [--require-tls | --no-require-tls] ^
    [--idle-client-timeout value] ^
    [--debug-logging | --no-debug-logging] ^
    [--tags comma_separated_list]
```

 To create the required information and associations for the proxy, you also use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/register-db-proxy-targets.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/register-db-proxy-targets.html) command\. Currently, all proxies have a single target group named `default`\. Aurora creates this target group automatically for each proxy\. 

```
aws rds register-db-proxy-targets
    --db-proxy-name value
    [--target-group-name default]
    [--db-instance-identifiers space_separated_list]  # rds db instances, or
    [--db-cluster-identifiers cluster_id]        # rds db cluster (all instances), or
    [--db-cluster-endpoint endpoint_name]          # rds db cluster endpoint (all instances)
```

#### RDS API<a name="rds-proxy-creating.API"></a>

 To create an RDS Proxy, you call the Amazon RDS API function [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDBProxy.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDBProxy.html)\. You pass a parameter with the [AuthConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_AuthConfig.html) data structure\. 

 Currently, all proxies have a single target group named `default`\. Aurora creates this target group automatically for each proxy\. You associate an RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster with the target group by calling the function [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterDBProxyTargets.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterDBProxyTargets.html)\. 

### Viewing an RDS Proxy<a name="rds-proxy-viewing"></a>

 After you create one or more RDS proxies, you can view them all to examine their configuration details and choose which ones to modify, delete, and so on\. 

 In particular, you need the endpoint for the proxy to use in the connection string for any database applications that use the proxy\. 

#### AWS Management Console<a name="rds-proxy-viewing.console"></a>

**To view your RDS Proxy**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1.  In the upper\-right corner of the AWS Management Console, choose the AWS Region in which you created the RDS Proxy\. 

1.  In the navigation pane, choose **Proxies**\. 

1.  Choose the name of an RDS proxy to display its details\. 

1.  On the details page, the **Target groups** section shows how the proxy is associated with a specific RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster\. You can follow the link to the **default** target group page to see more details about the association between the proxy and the database\. This page is where you see settings that you specified when creating the proxy, such as maximum connection percentage, connection borrow timeout, engine compatibility, and session pinning filters\. 

#### CLI<a name="rds-proxy-viewing.cli"></a>

 To view your RDS Proxy using the CLI, use the [ `describe-db-proxies`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-proxies.html) command\. By default, it displays all proxies owned by your AWS account\. To see details for a single proxy, specify its name with the `--db-proxy-name` parameter\. 

```
aws rds describe-db-proxies [--db-proxy-name proxy_name]
```

 To view the other information associated with the proxy, use these commands: 

```
aws rds describe-db-proxy-target-groups  --db-proxy-name proxy_name

aws rds describe-db-proxy-targets --db-proxy-name proxy_name
```

 Use the following sequence of commands to see more detail about the things that are associated with the proxy: 
+  Run [ `describe-db-proxies`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-proxies.html) to get a list of proxies\. 
+  Run [ `describe-db-proxy-target-groups`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-proxy-target-groups.html) ` -—db-proxy-name` using the name of the proxy as the parameter value\. This output shows connection parameters such as the maximum percentage of connections that the proxy can use\. 
+  Run [ `describe-db-proxy-targets`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-proxy-targets.html) to see the details of the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster associated with the returned target group\. 

#### RDS API<a name="rds-proxy-viewing.api"></a>

 To view your proxies using the RDS API, use the [DescribeDBProxies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBProxies.html) operation\. It returns values of the [DBProxy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DBProxy.html) data type\. 

 You can use the proxy identifiers from the return value to see details of the connection settings for the proxy by using the [DescribeDBProxyTargetGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBProxyTargetGroups.html) operation\. It returns values of the [DBProxyTargetGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DBProxyTargetGroup.html) data type\. 

 You can see the RDS instance or Aurora DB cluster associated with the proxy by using the [DescribeDBProxyTargets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBProxyTargets.html) operation\. It returns values of the [DBProxyTarget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DBProxyTarget.html) data type\. 

## Connecting to a Database through RDS Proxy<a name="rds-proxy-connecting"></a>

****  
***This is preview documentation for Amazon RDS Proxy\. It is subject to change\.***

 You connect to an RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster through a proxy in generally the same way as you connect directly to the database\. The main difference is that you specify the proxy endpoint instead of the instance or cluster endpoint\. 

 For an Aurora DB cluster, all proxy connections have read\-write capability and use the writer instance\. If you use the reader endpoint for read\-only connections, you continue using the reader endpoint the same way\. 

For PostgreSQL, if you use JDBC we recommend that you set the connection parameter `assumeMinServerVersion` to at least 9\.0 to avoid pinning\. See also [Avoiding Pinning](#rds-proxy-pinning)\.

**Topics**
+ [Connecting to a Proxy Using Native Authentication](#rds-proxy-connecting-native)
+ [Connecting to a Proxy Using IAM Authentication](#rds-proxy-connecting-iam)

### Connecting to a Proxy Using Native Authentication<a name="rds-proxy-connecting-native"></a>

 Use the following general procedure to connect to a proxy using native authentication: 
+  Find the proxy endpoint\. In the AWS Management Console, you can find the endpoint on the details page for the corresponding proxy\. With the AWS CLI, you can use the [ `describe-db-proxies`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-proxies.html) command\. The following example shows how\. 

  ```
  # Add --output text to get output as a simple tab-separated list.
  $ aws rds describe-db-proxies --query '*[*].{DBProxyName:DBProxyName,Endpoint:Endpoint}'
  [
      [
          {
              "Endpoint": "the-proxy.proxy-demo.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
              "DBProxyName": "the-proxy"
          },
          {
              "Endpoint": "the-proxy-other-secret.proxy-demo.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
              "DBProxyName": "the-proxy-other-secret"
          },
          {
              "Endpoint": "the-proxy-rds-secret.proxy-demo.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
              "DBProxyName": "the-proxy-rds-secret"
          },
          {
              "Endpoint": "the-proxy-t3.proxy-demo.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
              "DBProxyName": "the-proxy-t3"
          }
      ]
  ]
  ```
+  Specify that endpoint as the host parameter in the connection string for your client application\. For example, specify the proxy endpoint as the value for the `mysql -h` option or `psql -h` option\.
+  Supply the same database user name and password as you normally do\. 

### Connecting to a Proxy Using IAM Authentication<a name="rds-proxy-connecting-iam"></a>

 Follow the same general procedure as for connecting to an RDS DB instance or Aurora cluster using IAM authentication\. Instead of the instance, cluster, or reader endpoint, specify the proxy endpoint\. For details, see [Connecting to Your DB Instance Using IAM Authentication](UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.Connecting.md)\.

Make sure that you use Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) / Secure Sockets Layer \(SSL\) when connecting to a proxy using IAM authentication\.

You can grant a specific user access to the proxy by modifying the IAM policy\. For example:

```
"Resource": "arn:aws:rds-db:us-east-2:1234567890:dbuser:db-ABCDEFGHIJKL01234/db_user”
```

## Managing RDS Proxy<a name="rds-proxy-managing"></a>

****  
***This is preview documentation for Amazon RDS Proxy\. It is subject to change\.***

 The following explain aspects of RDS Proxy operation and configuration that help your application to make the most efficient use of database connections and achieve maximum connection reuse\. The more you can take advantage of connection reuse, the more CPU and memory overhead you can save\. This in turn reduces latency for your application and enables the database to devote more of its resources to processing application requests\. 

**Topics**
+ [Deleting an RDS Proxy](#rds-proxy-deleting)
+ [Modifying an RDS Proxy](#rds-proxy-modifying-proxy)
+ [Adding a New Database User](#rds-proxy-new-db-user)

+ [Avoiding Pinning](#rds-proxy-pinning)

### Deleting an RDS Proxy<a name="rds-proxy-deleting"></a>

 You can delete a proxy if you no longer need it\. You might delete a proxy because the application that was using it is no longer relevant\. Or you might delete a proxy if you take the DB instance or cluster associated with it out of service\. 

#### AWS Management Console<a name="rds-proxy-deleting.console"></a>

**To delete a proxy**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1.  In the navigation pane, choose **Proxies**\. 

1.  Choose the proxy to delete from the list\. 

1.  Choose **Delete Proxy**\. 

#### AWS CLI<a name="rds-proxy-deleting.CLI"></a>

 To delete a DB proxy, use the AWS CLI command [ `delete-db-proxy`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/delete-db-proxy.html)\. To remove related associations, also use the [ `deregister-db-proxy-targets`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/deregister-db-proxy-targets.html) command\.

```
aws rds delete-db-proxy --name proxy_name
```

```
aws rds deregister-db-proxy-targets
    --db-proxy-name proxy_name
    [--target-group-name target_group_name]
    [--target-ids comma_separated_list]       # or
    [--db-instance-identifiers instance_id]       # or
    [--db-cluster-identifiers cluster_id]
```

#### RDS API<a name="rds-proxy-deleting.API"></a>

 To delete a DB proxy, call the Amazon RDS API function [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteDBProxy.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteDBProxy.html)\. To delete related items and associations, you also call the functions [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteDBProxyTargetGroup.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteDBProxyTargetGroup.html) and [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DeregisterDBProxyTargets.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DeregisterDBProxyTargets.html)\. 

### Modifying an RDS Proxy<a name="rds-proxy-modifying-proxy"></a>

 You can change certain settings associated with a proxy after you create the proxy\. You do so by modifying the proxy itself, its associated target group, or both\. Each proxy has an associated target group\. 

#### AWS Management Console<a name="rds-proxy-modifying-proxy.console"></a>

**To modify the settings for a proxy**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1.  In the navigation pane, choose **Proxies**\. 

1.  In the list of proxies, choose the proxy whose settings you want to modify or go to its details page\. 

1.  For **Actions**, choose **Modify**\. 

1.  Enter or choose the properties to modify\. You can do the following:
   +  Rename the proxy by entering a new identifier\. 
   +  Turn the requirement for Transport layer Security \(TLS\) on or off\. 
   +  Enter a time period for the idle connection timeout\. 
   +  Add or remove Secrets Manager secrets\. These secrets correspond to database user names and passwords\. 
   + Change the IAM role used to retrieve the secrets from Secrets Manager\. 
   + Require or disallow IAM authentication for connections to the proxy\. 
   +  Add or remove VPC subnets for the proxy to use\. 
   +  Add or remove VPC security groups for the proxy to use\. 
   +  Enable or disable enhanced logging\. 

1.  Choose **Modify**\. 

 If you didn't find the settings you intended to change, continue with the following procedure to update the target group for the proxy\. Each proxy has one associated target group, which is created automatically along with the proxy\. 

**To modify the settings for a proxy target group**

 The target group associated with a proxy controls the settings related to the physical database connections\. You can only modify the target group from the proxy details page, not from the list on the **Proxies** page\. 

1.  From the **Proxies** page, go to the details page for a proxy\. 

1.  For **Target groups**, choose the `default` link\. Currently, all proxies have a single target group named `default`\. 

1.  On the details page for the **default** target group, choose **Modify**\. 

1.  Certain properties, such as the target group identifier and the database engine, are fixed\. You can't change these properties\. 

    Choose new settings for the properties you can modify: 
   +  You can choose a different RDS DB instance or Aurora cluster\. 
   +  You can adjust what percentage of the maximum available connections the proxy can use\. 
   +  You can select a session pinning filter\. This setting can help reduce performance issues due to insufficient transaction\-level reuse for connections\. Using this setting requires understanding of application behavior and the circumstances under which RDS Proxy pins a session to a database connection\. 
   +  You can adjust the connection borrow timeout interval\. This setting determines how long the proxy waits for a connection to become available before returning a timeout error, when the proxy already has the maximum number of connections being used\. 

1.  Choose **Modify target group**\. 

#### AWS CLI<a name="rds-proxy-modifying-proxy.cli"></a>

 To modify a proxy using the AWS CLI, use the commands [modify\-db\-proxy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-proxy.html), [modify\-db\-proxy\-target\-group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-proxy-target-group.html), [deregister\-db\-proxy\-targets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/deregister-db-proxy-targets.html), and [register\-db\-proxy\-targets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/register-db-proxy-targets.html)\.

 With the `modify-db-proxy` command, you can change properties such as the following:
+ The set of Secrets Manager secrets used by the proxy\.
+ Whether TLS is required\.
+ The idle client timeout\.
+ Whether to log additional information from SQL statements for debugging\.
+ The IAM role used to retrieve Secrets Manager secrets\.
+ The security groups used by the proxy\.

 The following example shows how to rename an existing proxy\. 

```
aws rds modify-db-proxy --db-proxy-name the-proxy --new-db-proxy-name the_new_name
```

 With the `modify-db-proxy-target-group` command, you can modify connection\-related settings or rename the target group\. Currently, all proxies have a single target group named `default`\. When working with this target group, you specify the name of the proxy and `default` for the name of the target group\. 

 The following example shows how to first check the `MaxConnectionsPercent` setting for a proxy and then change it, using the target group\. 

```
aws rds describe-db-proxy-target-groups --db-proxy-name the-proxy

{
    "TargetGroups": [
        {
            "Status": "available",
            "UpdatedDate": "2019-11-30T16:49:30.342Z",
            "ConnectionPoolConfig": {
                "MaxIdleConnectionsPercent": 50, 
                "ConnectionBorrowTimeout": 120,
                "MaxConnectionsPercent": 100,
                "SessionPinningFilters": []
            },
            "TargetGroupName": "default",
            "CreatedDate": "2019-11-30T16:49:27.940Z",
            "DBProxyName": "the-proxy",
            "IsDefault": true
        }
    ]
}

aws rds modify-db-proxy-target-group --db-proxy-name the-proxy --target-group-name default --connection-pool-config '
{ "MaxIdleConnectionsPercent": 75 }'

{
    "DBProxyTargetGroup": {
        "Status": "available",
        "UpdatedDate": "2019-12-02T04:09:50.420Z",
        "ConnectionPoolConfig": {
            "MaxIdleConnectionsPercent": 75,
            "ConnectionBorrowTimeout": 120,
            "MaxConnectionsPercent": 100,
            "SessionPinningFilters": []
        },
        "TargetGroupName": "default",
        "CreatedDate": "2019-11-30T16:49:27.940Z",
        "DBProxyName": "the-proxy",
        "IsDefault": true
    }
}
```

 With the `deregister-db-proxy-targets` and `register-db-proxy-targets` commands, you change which RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster the proxy is associated with through its target group\. Currently, each proxy can connect to one RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster\. The target group tracks the connection details for all the RDS DB instances in a multi\-AZ configuration, or all the DB instances in an Aurora cluster\. 

 The following example starts with a proxy that is associated with an Aurora MySQL cluster named `cluster-56-2020-02-25-1399`\. The example shows how to change the proxy so that it can connect to a different cluster named `provisioned-cluster`\. When you work with an RDS DB instance, you specify the `--db-instance-identifier` option\. When you work with an Aurora DB cluster, you specify the `--db-cluster-identifier` option instead\. The following example modifies an Aurora MySQL proxy\. An Aurora PostgreSQL proxy would have port 5432\.

```
aws rds describe-db-proxy-targets --db-proxy-name the-proxy

{
    "Targets": [
        {
            "Endpoint": "instance-9814.demo.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",

            "Port": 3306,
            "RdsResourceId": "instance-1018"
        },
        {
            "Type": "TRACKED_CLUSTER",
            "Port": 0,
            "RdsResourceId": "cluster-56-2020-02-25-1399"
        },
        {
            "Endpoint": "instance-4330.demo.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",

            "Port": 3306,
            "RdsResourceId": "instance-4330"
        }
    ]
}

    ]
}
```

#### RDS API<a name="rds-proxy-modifying-proxy.api"></a>

 To modify a proxy using the RDS API, you use the operations [ModifyDBProxy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyDBProxy.html), [ModifyDBProxyTargetGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyDBProxyTargetGroup.html), [DeregisterDBProxyTargets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DeregisterDBProxyTargets.html), and [RegisterDBProxyTargets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterDBProxyTargets.html) operations\. 

 With `ModifyDBProxy`, you can change properties such as the following:
+ The set of Secrets Manager secrets used by the proxy\. 
+ Whether TLS is required\.
+ The idle client timeout\.
+ Whether to log additional information from SQL statements for debugging\.
+ The IAM role used to retrieve Secrets Manager secrets\.
+ The security groups used by the proxy\. 

 With `ModifyDBProxyTargetGroup`, you can modify connection\-related settings or rename the target group\. Currently, all proxies have a single target group named `default`\. When working with this target group, you specify the name of the proxy and `default` for the name of the target group\. 

 With `DeregisterDBProxyTargets` and `RegisterDBProxyTargets`, you change which RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster the proxy is associated with through its target group\. Currently, each proxy can connect to one RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster\. The target group tracks the connection details for all the RDS DB instances in a multi\-AZ configuration, or all the DB instances in an Aurora cluster\. 

### Adding a New Database User<a name="rds-proxy-new-db-user"></a>

 In some cases, you might add a new database user to an RDS DB instance or Aurora cluster that's associated with a proxy\. If so, add or repurpose a Secrets Manager secret to store the credentials for that user\. To do this, choose one of the following options: 
+  Create a new Secrets Manager secret, using the procedure described in [Setting Up Database Credentials in AWS Secrets Manager](#rds-proxy-secrets-arns)\. 
+  If the new user takes the place of an existing one, update the credentials stored in the proxy's Secrets Manager secret for the existing user\. 

### Changing the Password for a Database User<a name="rds-proxy-changing-db-user-password"></a>

 In some cases, you might change the password for a database user in an RDS DB instance or Aurora cluster that's associated with a proxy\. If so, update the corresponding Secrets Manager secret with the new password\. 

### Controlling Connection Limits and Timeouts<a name="rds-proxy-connection-limits"></a>

 RDS Proxy makes use of the `max_connections` setting for your RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster\. This setting represents the overall upper limit on the connections that the proxy can open at any one time\. In Aurora clusters and RDS multi\-AZ configurations, the `max_connections` value that the proxy uses is the one for the Aurora primary instance or the RDS writer instance\. 

 The proxy setting for maximum connections represents a percentage of the `max_connections` value\. If you have multiple applications all using the same database, you can effectively divide their connection quotas by using a proxy for each application with a specific percentage of `max_connections`\. If you do so, ensure that the percentages add up to 100 or less for all proxies associated with the same database\. 

 RDS Proxy periodically disconnects idle connections and returns them to the connection pool\. You can adjust this timeout interval\. Doing so helps your applications to deal with stale resources, especially if the application mistakenly leaves a connection open while holding important database resources\. 

### Monitoring and Managing Connection Pooling<a name="rds-proxy-connection-pooling-tuning"></a>

 As described in the concepts on [Connection Pooling](#rds-proxy-connection-pooling), connection pooling is a crucial RDS Proxy feature\. Following, you can learn how to make the most efficient use of connection pooling and transaction\-level connection reuse \(multiplexing\)\. 

 Because the connection pool is managed by RDS Proxy, you can monitor it and adjust connection limits and timeout intervals without changing your application code\. 

 For each proxy, you can specify an upper limit on the number of connections used by the connection pool\. You specify the limit as a percentage\. This percentage applies to the maximum connections configured in the database\. The exact number varies depending on the DB instance size and configuration settings\. 

For example, suppose that you configured RDS Proxy to use 75 percent of the maximum connections for the database\. For MySQL, the maximum value is defined by the `max_connections` configuration parameter\. In this case, the other 25 percent of maximum connections remain available to assign to other proxies or for connections that don't go through a proxy\. In some cases, the proxy might keep less than 75% of the maximum connections open at a particular time\. Those cases might include situations where the database doesn't have many simultaneous connections, or some connections stay idle for long periods\. 

 The overall number of connections available for the connection pool changes as you update the `max_connections` configuration setting that applies to an RDS DB instance or an Aurora cluster\. 

 The proxy doesn't reserve all of these connections in advance\. Thus, you can specify a relatively large percentage, and those connections are only opened when the proxy becomes busy enough to need them\. 

 You can choose how long to wait for a connection to become available for use by your application\. This setting is represented by the **Connection borrow timeout** option when you create a proxy\. This setting specifies how long to wait for a connection to become available in the connection pool before returning a timeout error\. It applies when the number of connections is at the maximum, and so no connections are available in the connection pool\. It also applies if no writer instance is available because a failover operation is in process\. This setting enables you to limit the wait period that is most suitable for your application without having to change the query timeout in your application code\. 

### Avoiding Pinning<a name="rds-proxy-pinning"></a>

 Multiplexing is more efficient when database requests don't rely on state information from previous requests\. In that case, RDS Proxy can reuse a connection at the conclusion of each transaction\. Examples of such state information include most variables and configuration parameters that you can change through `SET` or `SELECT` statements\. SQL transactions on a client connection can multiplex between underlying database connections by default\. 

 Your connections to the proxy can enter a state known as *pinning*\. When a connection is pinned, each later transaction uses the same underlying database connection until the session ends\. RDS Proxy automatically pins a client connection to a specific DB connection when it detects a session state change that isn't appropriate for other sessions\. Pinning reduces the effectiveness of connection reuse\. If all or almost all of your connections experience pinning, consider modifying your application code or workload to reduce the conditions that cause the pinning\. 

 For example, if your application changes a session variable or configuration parameter, later statements can rely on the new variable or parameter to be in effect\. Thus, when RDS Proxy processes requests to change session variables or configuration settings, it pins that session to the DB connection\. That way, the session state remains in effect for all later transactions in the same session\. 

This rule doesn't apply to all parameters you can set\. RDS Proxy tracks changes to the character set, collation, time zone, autocommit, current database, SQL mode, and `session_track_schema` settings\. Thus RDS Proxy doesn't pin the session when you modify these\. In this case, RDS Proxy only reuses the connection for other sessions that have the same values for those settings\. 

 Performance tuning for RDS Proxy involves trying to maximize transaction\-level connection reuse \(multiplexing\) by minimizing pinning\. You can do so by using the following techniques: 
+  Avoid unnecessary database requests that could cause pinning\. 
+  Set variables and configuration settings consistently across all connections\. That way, later sessions are more likely to reuse connections that have those particular settings\. 

  However, for PostgreSQL setting a variable will lead to session pinning\.
+  Apply a session pinning filter to the proxy\. You can exempt certain kinds of operations from pinning the session if you know that doing so doesn't affect the correct operation of your application\. 
+  Monitor the CloudWatch metric `DatabaseConnectionsCurrentlySessionPinned` to see how frequently pinning occurs\. For information about this and other CloudWatch metrics, see [Monitoring RDS Proxy Using Amazon CloudWatchMonitoring RDS Proxy](#rds-proxy.monitoring)\. 
+  If you use `SET` statements to perform identical initialization for each client connection, you can do so while still preserving transaction\-level multiplexing\. In this case, you move the statements that set up the initial session state into the initialization query used by a proxy\. This property is a string containing one or more SQL statements, separated by semicolons\. For example, you can define an initialization query for a proxy that sets certain configuration parameters\. Then, RDS Proxy applies those settings whenever it sets up a new connection for that proxy\. You can remove the corresponding `SET` statements from your application code, so that they don't interfere with transaction\-level multiplexing\. 

  You can work with the initialization query through the AWS CLI and RDS API\. Currently, you can't set this property through the AWS Management Console\. For PostgreSQL, the initialization query is not currently implemented\. 

 The proxy pins the session to the current connection in the following situations where multiplexing might cause unexpected behavior: 
+  Any statement with a text size greater than 16 KB causes the proxy to pin the session\. 
+  Prepared statements cause the proxy to pin the session\. This rule applies whether the prepared statement uses SQL text or the binary protocol\. 
+  Explicit MySQL statements `LOCK TABLE`, `LOCK TABLES`, or `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK` cause the proxy to pin the session\. 
+  Setting a user variable or a system variable \(with some exceptions\) causes the proxy to pin the session\. If this situation reduces your connection reuse too much, you can choose for `SET` operations not to cause pinning\. 
+  Creating a temporary table causes the proxy to pin the session\. That way, the contents of the temporary table are preserved throughout the session regardless of transaction boundaries\. 
+  Calling the MySQL functions `ROW_COUNT()`, `FOUND_ROWS()`, or `LAST_INSERT_ID()` sometimes causes pinning and sometimes not\. 

  The behavior might be different between Aurora MySQL versions that are compatible with MySQL 5\.6 and MySQL 5\.7\. 

 Calling MySQL stored procedures and stored functions doesn't cause pinning\. RDS Proxy doesn't detect any session state changes resulting from such calls\. Therefore, make sure your that application doesn't change session state inside stored routines and rely on that session state to persist across transactions\. For example, if a stored procedure creates a temporary table that is intended to persist across transactions, that application currently isn't compatible with RDS Proxy\. 

For PostgreSQL, the following interactions cause pinning:
+ Using SET commands
+ Using the extended query protocol such as by using JDBC default settings
+ Creating temporary sequences, tables, or views
+ Declaring cursors
+ Discarding the session state
+ Listening on a notification channel
+ Loading a library module such as `auto_explain`
+ Manipulating sequences using functions such as `nextval()` and `setval()`
+ Interacting with locks using functions such as `pg_advisory_lock()` and `pg_try_advisory_lock()`
+ Using prepared statements, setting parameters, or resetting a parameter to its default

 If you have expert knowledge about your application behavior, you can choose to skip the pinning behavior for certain application statements\. You do so by choosing the **Session pinning filters** option when creating the proxy\.  Currently, you can opt out of session pinning for the following kinds of application statements: 
+  Setting session variables and configuration settings\. 

 To see metrics about how often pinning occurs for a proxy, see [Monitoring RDS Proxy Using Amazon CloudWatchMonitoring RDS Proxy](#rds-proxy.monitoring)\. 

## Monitoring RDS Proxy Using Amazon CloudWatch<a name="rds-proxy.monitoring"></a>

****  
***This is preview documentation for Amazon RDS Proxy\. It is subject to change\.***

 You can monitor RDS Proxy using Amazon CloudWatch\. CloudWatch collects and processes raw data from the proxies into readable, near real\-time metrics\. To find these metrics in the CloudWatch console, choose **Metrics**, then choose **RDS**, and choose **Per\-Proxy Metrics**\. 

**Note**  
 RDS publishes these metrics for each underlying EC2 instance associated with the proxy\. A single proxy might be served by more than one EC2 instance\. Use CloudWatch statistics to aggregate the values for a proxy across all the associated instances\.   
 Some of these metrics might not be visible until after the first successful connection by a proxy\. 

 All RDS Proxy metrics are in the group `proxy`, with a dimension of `ProxyName`\.

## Command\-Line Examples for RDS Proxy<a name="rds-proxy.examples"></a>

****  
***This is preview documentation for Amazon RDS Proxy\. It is subject to change\.***

 To see how combinations of connection commands and SQL statements interact with RDS Proxy, look at the following examples\. 

**Examples**
+ [Preserving Connections to a MySQL Database Across a Failover](#example-mysql-preserve-connections)
+ [Adjusting the max_connections Setting for an Aurora DB Cluster](#example-adjust-cluster-max-connections)

**Example Preserving Connections to a MySQL Database Across a Failover**  
 This MySQL example demonstrates how open connections continue working during a failover, for example when you reboot a database or it becomes unavailable due to a problem\. This example uses a proxy named `the-proxy` and an Aurora DB cluster with DB instances `instance-8898` and `instance-9814`\. When you run the `failover-db-cluster` command from the Linux command line, the writer instance that the proxy is connected to changes to a different DB instance\. You can see that the DB instance associated with the proxy changes while the connection remains open\.   

```
$ mysql -h the-proxy.proxy-demo.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin_user -p
Enter password:
...

mysql> select @@aurora_server_id;

**Example Adjusting the max\_connections Setting for an Aurora DB Cluster**  
This example demonstrates how you can adjust the `max_connections` setting for an Aurora MySQL DB cluster\. To do so, you create your own DB cluster parameter group based on the default parameter settings for clusters that are compatible with MySQL 5\.6 or 5\.7\. You specify a value for the `max_connections` setting, overriding the formula that sets the default value\. You associate the DB cluster parameter group with your DB cluster\.   

```
export REGION=us-east-1
export CLUSTER_PARAM_GROUP=rds-proxy-mysql-56-max-connections-demo
export CLUSTER_NAME=rds-proxy-mysql-56

aws rds create-db-parameter-group --region $REGION \
  --db-parameter-group-family aurora5.6 \
  --db-parameter-group-name $CLUSTER_PARAM_GROUP \
  --description "Aurora MySQL 5.6 cluster parameter group for RDS Proxy demo."

aws rds modify-db-cluster --region $REGION \
  --db-cluster-identifier $CLUSTER_NAME \
  --db-cluster-parameter-group-name $CLUSTER_PARAM_GROUP

echo "New cluster param group is assigned to cluster:"
aws rds describe-db-clusters --region $REGION \

### CloudWatch Logs<a name="rds-proxy-logs"></a>

 You can find logs of RDS Proxy activity under CloudWatch in the AWS Management Console\. Each proxy has an entry in the **Log groups** page\. 

**Important**  
 These logs are intended for human consumption for troubleshooting purposes and not for programmatic access\. The format and content of the logs is subject to change \(especially during preview\)\. 

### Verifying Connectivity to a Proxy<a name="rds-proxy-verifying"></a>

 You can use the following commands to verify that all components of the connection mechanism can communicate with the other components\. 

 Examine the proxy itself using the [ `describe-db-proxies`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-proxies.html) command\. Also examine the associated target groups and the targets specified in the target groups using the [ `describe-db-proxy-target-groups`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-proxy-target-groups.html) and [ `describe-db-proxy-targets`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-proxy-targets.html) commands\. Check that the details of the targets match the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster that you intend to associate with the proxy\. 

```
aws rds describe-db-proxies --db-proxy-name $DB_PROXY_NAME
aws rds describe-db-proxy-target-groups --db-proxy-name $DB_PROXY_NAME
aws rds describe-db-proxy-targets --db-proxy-name $DB_PROXY_NAME
```

 If the following Netcat command \(`nc`\) is successful, you can access the proxy endpoint from the EC2 instance or other system where you're logged in\. This command reports failure if you're not in the same VPC as the proxy and the associated database\. You might be able to log directly in to the database without being in the same VPC\. However, you can't log into the proxy unless you're in the same VPC\. 

```
nc -zx MySQL_proxy_endpoint 3306

nc -zx PostgreSQL_proxy_endpoint 5432
```

 You can use the following commands to make sure that your EC2 instance has the required properties\. In particular, the VPC for the EC2 instance must be the same as the VPC for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster that the proxy connects to\. 

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids your_ec2_instance_id
```

 Examine the Secrets Manager secrets used for the proxy\. 

```
aws secretsmanager list-secrets
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id your_secret_id
```

 Make sure that the `SecretString` field displayed by `get-secret-value` is encoded as a JSON string that includes `username` and `password` fields\. The following example shows the format of the `SecretString` field\. 

```
{
  "ARN": "some_arn",
  "Name": "some_name",
  "VersionId": "some_version_id",
  "SecretString": '{"username":"some_username","password":"some_password"}',
  "VersionStages": [ "some_stage" ],
  "CreatedDate": some_timestamp
}
```

 Examine the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster that you associated with the proxy\. For an Aurora DB cluster, also examine each of the DB instances in the cluster\. Make sure that their properties match what's expected for the proxy, such as the port being 3306 for MySQL and 5432 for PostgreSQL\. 

```
aws rds describe-db-clusters --db-cluster-id $DB_CLUSTER_ID
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-id $DB_INSTANCE_ID1
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-id $DB_INSTANCE_ID2
```
